      ],
      "responses": [
        "There are several common types of refrigerator water filters, and the specific one you need depends on your refrigerator model. Here are some of the most frequently used ones:\n\n1. **Inline Filters (e.g., PS10043223)**  \n   These are installed in the water line leading to the refrigerator and are often used for ice makers and water dispensers.\n\n2. **Internal Filters (e.g., PS11702746)**  \n   These are located inside the refrigerator, typically in the grille at the bottom or inside the refrigerator compartment. They are common in many modern refrigerators.\n\n3. **Canister Filters (e.g., PS10194957)**  \n   These are cylindrical filters that are often installed in the refrigerator's base grille or inside the refrigerator compartment.\n\n4. **Twist-In Filters (e.g., PS11702746)**  \n   These are designed to twist into place and are commonly found in the refrigerator's upper-right corner or inside the refrigerator compartment.\n\n5. **Push-In Filters (e.g., PS11702746)**  \n   These are pushed into a housing and are often found in the refrigerator's grille or inside the compartment.\n\nTo determine the correct filter for your refrigerator, you’ll need to check your owner’s manual or the model number of your refrigerator. If you provide your refrigerator model number, I can help you find the exact filter you need! Let me know if you'd like assistance with installation instructions as well."
