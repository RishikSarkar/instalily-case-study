This part attaches to the tubing of the evaporator coil in the freezer. A faulty defrost termination thermostat may result in the defrost heater never heating and a solid frost buildup on the evaporator coil, which results in too warm temperatures. The thermostat contacts are normally closed and have continuity until it reaches 140 degrees. If this high limit thermostat is open at room temperature or colder, it is defective. This limit thermostat has an attached mounting clip and comes with pink and amber wire leads. The thermostat is 1 inch in diameter and 1/2 inch thick, the 2 wire leads are 10 inches long.",

Defrosted all of the ice off the coils and heater.4. I replaced the defrost thermostat and heater by following the directions that came with them. The directions are very clear and easy to follow. I had a single element heater, and the replacement was a double element, the directions even explained how to rearrange the wires to make it work. The whole job only really consisted of cutting two wires that are color coded on the thermostat and resplicing the new ones in. I used scotch locks and electrical tape for the splices. The element had connectors on it so I just removed two screws, unplugged two wires and plugged them on the new one.The greatest thing about this repair was that I troubleshot the problem using the PartSelect website, ordered the parts and they arrived at my house in less than 24 hours.Thank You."

The condenser fan motor had seized and I thought this is something even I can replace.I did a Google search on the refrigerator model number. The link to your site looked promising and I clicked on it. I was taken to your web page for my refrigerator and I clicked on the schematic for the condenser assembly.The schematic had the parts I needed labeled clearly so this layman could be sure to get the right ones.I ordered the parts at 12:45PM Monday and selected overnight shipping. The parts arrived at 8:35AM Tuesday (Thank you FedEx). I installed the parts and my refrigerator is up and running again.To get to the condenser fan motor I took off the back panel on the fridge that covers the condenser, fan and coil. The fan/motor assembly is attached to a bracket I removed with two screws. Pulled the bracket assembly out of the back of the fridge, removed the fan blade and then the motor, and put the new motor on the bracket and stuck the new fan blade on the motor spindle. The trickiest part was getting the complete assembly back in. Just went slowly and took my time. Reconnected the wires,  no problems. I took pictures of everything that I disassembled BEFORE I disassembled it in case I wasn't sure how something went back in but this job was so simple I didn't need the pictures.I’m not sure how I could improve on this except maybe you could ship a refrigerator technician, too, to do the install.Thank you PartSelect everything worked out better than I could have hoped and I saved $220.00 compared to what a repair service was quoting."

This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This part is located inside of the control housing on most models, and is approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. This part is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white.

        "content": "I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or  the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator  problem had passsed through  the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated  several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly  paying close attention to fragile parts."

It snaps into place on the appliance’s pantry drawer to help contain the items inside and to keep your refrigerator door from sliding all the way out. It is rated as \"medium\" difficulty to install, is constructed of plastic and comes in white. If broken or missing, the pantry drawer will not stay in place and the part should be replaced. Refer to your user manual and model number to ensure this is the correct part for you. This kit includes both the right and left side end caps, as well as the pins that will hold them in place. To replace an end cap, remove the three screws holding it in place. Then, remove the pin and end cap, replacing the old end cap with the new end cap. In the past, the left and right end caps were sold separately, but the part has been updated and now includes both sides. The part is sold as a kit, and unfortunately, as such none of the parts are available individually.",

I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not.  It was simple to replace.  Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan.  Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient.  I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long.  Thanks to PartSelect I proved KitchenAid and the repaiirmen wrong and did it myself!  Thank you PartSelect!"

I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not.  It was simple to replace.  Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan.  Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient.  I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long.

The washer is found on dryers around the drum support rollers and idler pulleys, and helps prevent the rollers and pulleys from bumping up against the brackets they are installed on. Your thrust washer could be defective if you notice your dryer wont tumble, rotate, or turn; or there is a load squealing or whining noise when the dryer tumbles. The repair is a relatively easy job. You will require a putty knife, 5/16 inch nut driver, and E-Ring pliers. Remember to disconnect the power to your dryer before you begin the repair.",

        "content": "1. Removed lint screen and holder frame. Unplugged the electrical cord and closed the gas valve in the line before it goes into the dryer.2. Removed two bolts at bottom front of machine and took off the bottom front panel.3. Removed three bolts from black plastic exit vent and took it out to give more room to access everything.4. removed two wires and  screws on the limit thermostat. Did the reverse to place the new one.5. Removed wires (remembering placement), then holder screw. rotated the Gas Dryer Sensor counter clockwise to release the bottom tab so the sensor can be taken off the flame tube. Did the reverse to place the new one on.6. Removed the one screw on the gas/flame tube that holds the bracket and igniter inside the flame tube. Removed the wires fro the igniter (remember placement) Slid the whole assembly toward the back of the machine to get the tube off the gas valve then rotated the whole assembly counter-clocwise to release the tab on the left side of the bracket. This was a little tight and had to work with it a bit to get the tab out and slide the whole piece out of the flame tube.7. Once the tube and igniter were out i removed the scree that holds the igniter and replaced with the new one. Made sure no dust, etc. was in the piece.8. Did the reverse to place the tube/igniter back into the flame tube.9. Carefully  and forcefully removed the wire connectors to the two coils. These were tough to get off. Removed the two screws that hold the bracket that holds the two coils in place. Slid the coils off the spindles remembering which one has the two wire connection and which one has the three wire connection and the way they went on. Replaced the old with the new. Placed the bracket onto the new coils and made sure the little bumps on the top are in the holes in the bracket. Tightened the screws to hold the coil bracket. Reattached the wire connectors to the coils making sure they go ALL the way back on. 10. Vaccumed everything I could to get lint, dust, etc. out. 11.Replaced the black vent plastic.12 Made sure the exit vent on the back was not crimped or clogged. Checked the little flap door where the vent goes outside to make sure it opens and closes super easy to no air flow is restricted.13. For testing I left the bottom panel open. Make sure you closed the door, reconnect the plug and turn the gas valve back on. Hit the go button on autodry or timed dry. The door must be closed to create the closed circulation of the system so the fan sucks the flame into the tube otherwise the flame will not fire deep  into the tube and will set off one fo the overheat sensors. After hitting the go button your drum will start to rotate, then a few seconds later you'll hear a click and your igniter will start to burn bright orange. Another click and the gas should flow and ignite. 14. This shows that you've fixed the ignition problem. I just replaced everything I thought that could be wrong in stead of hunting and trial and error. All the parts were about $137 so I thought it was worth making sure. 15. IMPORTANT: If during your test the flame turns off after a little while then turns back on only to turn off again, don't panic. This happened to me as well. I found that you need to run the dryer with wet clothes in the dryer. The wetness in the clothes will keep the autodry sensor from shutting off the dryer since there will be moisture in the exhaust. If it's on timed dry the wet clothes will cool the exhaust air and keep the overheat sensors from turning the heat off. So no heating of dry clothes to get out wrinkles. Just dry the wet clothes. This is all I did and it's been working great so far. Good Luck!"

Clean out all the dust bunnies. Schematics were a great resource. Those and the prices made me a repeat customer.The shaft of the Idler Lever wheel was the cause, but decided, since I had it apart, to spend a little more money and replace both Drum Support Rollers and the Roller Bracket and Shaft Assembly.  They showed some wear, and the parts were very inexpensive. Make sure you have snap ring pliers with prongs that are smaller than the standard 0.40 to save some aggravation with the Drum Rollers.  $5 tool.  Total parts were less than $60. Probably saved $150+ in labor. Quieter than ever now.  Thanks!"

I then removed the 4 screws that hold the front piece in.pulled it off replaced brackets , installed self adhesive felt(stuck good) and then glides. Mine were thin but not the problem. I then reached under the drum and released the belt from the tensioner. I then pulled the whole drum out.This is the time to vacum out good. I could get to the rear rollers very easy. The left roller was shot and the shaft half wore into(the problem). I pulled off the two screws holding the roller support. Normally You have to remove the wheel with snap ring pliers first to remove the support. In this case snap ring long gone. Replaced support shaft, installed thrust washers and roller with grease for both sides. The right support shaft was still good. Removed tensioner pulley and inspected. It was just as good as the new one. Cleaned and greased and reinstalled. Put new belt on the tub and slid it back in. Be carefull to get the belt on the proper side of the tensioner. I then installed the front supprt in place to support the tub with the 4 screws. Spun the tub(felt good) then reached under and reinstalled belt to motor and tensioner.

        "content": "I troubleshot the problem by reading the electrical schematic and concluding the heating elements (defrost cables) were either defective or  the bi-metal temp sensor was open. When closed the temp sensor completes the circuit for the current to flow through the heaters to defrost the cooling coils every 8 hours and then when the bimetal opens at 55 degrees the circuit is open and the coils are cooled because the refridgeration motor is in run mode. A timer between the motor and heater elements also was defective. The timer controls the cooling period and the defrost period. I ohmed out each part according to the spec sheet of normal resistance of parts and thus the bimetal and timer were defective. I gather a surge of some duration and amplitude affected these parts because a storm 24 hours prior to refridgerator  problem had passsed through  the area and the AC electrical power had oscillated  several times during that event. I used hand tools to do the repair. If you are not mechanically inclined a step by step proceedure would be moot. It is a matter of disassembly and assembly  paying close attention to fragile parts."

Clean out all the dust bunnies. Schematics were a great resource. Those and the prices made me a repeat customer.The shaft of the Idler Lever wheel was the cause, but decided, since I had it apart, to spend a little more money and replace both Drum Support Rollers and the Roller Bracket and Shaft Assembly.  They showed some wear, and the parts were very inexpensive. Make sure you have snap ring pliers with prongs that are smaller than the standard 0.40 to save some aggravation with the Drum Rollers.  $5 tool.  Total parts were less than $60. Probably saved $150+ in labor. Quieter than ever now.  Thanks!"

Without this clamp, the hose is vulnerable to leaking and disconnecting from the tub during the wash cycle of the washer, which can present a serious safety hazard for the machine and your home. Clamps can wear out and lose their tension due to excessive vibrations, mechanical damage, and normal wear and tear, all things present within a washing machine. To replace this clamp, you will first need to turn off your washer and you will need access to the lower portion of the washer chassis, which may require one or multiple screwdrivers and wrenches. Once you have access, use your screwdriver to loosen this clamp, which can then be removed and replaced with the new clamp, which will need to be tightened securely. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the washer you originally disassembled.",

Reassemble the spring on the hinge pin in reverse order. Then snap the lid onto the spring using the two mounting \"posts\".  NOTE: I used a very fine needle nose pliers to move the two spring \"legs\" behind the detergent box edge after I had mounted the lid.

        "content": "The air inlet strip has a flap and two smaller side flaps that seal the bottom of the inner door to the bottom pan that hold the water.  The flaps don't form a watertight seal as they only serve to prevent the water surging during wash and rinse cycles from splashing out of the bottom pan onto the floor under the door.  What I learned after dismantling the door is that the problem I was having with water dripping from the bottom of the bottom of the outer door was being caused by a loose upper round louvered vent and not he lower vent strip.  If the lower vent strip were the problem, water would leak from the front lip of the bottom pan, which is located well behind the face of the front door panel.Here's my recommendation on the lower vent srtip repair.  Turn off the power to the unit at you breaker panel.  The air inlet strip is fastened to the backside of the inner stainleess steel door panel.  To access the screws the outer door panel must be removed.  Open the door and remove the six torx head screws that fasten the outer door panel to the stainless steel inner door.  Don't remove the two torx screws top dead center as they hold the door latch.  After removing the screws, raise the door up to the nearly closed position.  Lift up the outer door panel handle and door bottom to disengage the outer panel from the inner stainless door.  The next part is a little tricky since the vent strip hex head screws are at he bottom of the stainless door panel, facing out with the door closed.  The lip of the bottom stainless pan is high enough to make it a tight fit to access the screws.  There is also a steel bracket that is a door stiffener and holds electrical wiring.  I found removing the bracket held by a 1/4\" hex head screw on each side made access to the vent strip scews easier.  Lay flat on the floor.  With a 3/16\" nutdriver or socket wrench each of the five vent strip screws can be removed.  It's a tight fit between the bottom lip and door bottom, but it can be done.  Remove the old vent strip and attach the new one.  Make sure it fits snugly into the slot.  Best to have an extra pair of hands at this point to hold the stip securely in place while screws are reinserted from the opposite side.  Reassemble everything in reverse order.It was when I had the outer door panel off that I noticed my problem was water getting past the upper round louver vent seal and thus running down the inside of the outer panel.  Simple fix was to remove and clean the scale residue from the parts and door.  Then reassemble the vent and twitst tighten the vent to compress the rubber seal on the inside face of the door."

Works like a champ.  The one thing I did do at the same time is notice that there's only one return spring for the door handle (even though both the handle and latch bracket have hooks for springs on both sides.  I suspect this is what caused the door handle to break in the first place (the spring causes uneven tension on the handle, which over time caused the arms on the handle to catch and break).  So I also ordered a second spring, and when I attached the new door handle to the latch bracket assembly I also installed return springs on both sides.  With even tension, the handle doesn't tend to twist when it raises and lowers the latch, so hopefully won't break again.  Just a thought while you have the unit off the dishwasher."

Two days later the parts arrived and and i took the door off again. Then put the new cam on, applied a litle vasiline, put the door back on and forgot  that i ever had a problem.

Yikes, I shut it off!I took apart the pump housing at the bottom inside the dishwasher, expecting to find some kids toy plastic bit had got caught and had jammed the motor or something. But nothing there, and my dishwasher has a little screen to keep just such things from getting to the pump anyway. Hmmm.So, ran the dishwasher again, seemed ok now.A week later, same thing, burning smell. Pull it apart again, but no sign of trouble. But I know something is up, so I pull the kickplate and have a look underneath... Way at the back I see a red wire that looks a little melted, but it's hard to tell, so I pull the whole dishwasher out. Sure enough, one of the heater wires is melted and burned, and the plastic locknut holding that side of the heater is badly scorched. Looks like a little electrical fire, I'm lucky it didn't get out of hand!The heater still tests ok with an ohmeter, but I don't trust it now - order the heater and replacement locknut and washers. Didn't need to order washers, they come with the heater, oh well.Heater removal and replacement is very straight forward, but I added some high-temp gasket silicone sealant (Ultra Blue) around the seals as I think the original problem may have ben a bit of water leakage causing a short.Took about an hour to pull the dishwasher out, remove the heater and install the new one, put a new terminal on the heater wire, and put the whole thing back under the counter.Working great now. But not a problem I expected to have with a 2-year-old dishwasher!"

(you get the handle and latch already put together and it cost less than the latch assembly without the handle). Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill. Whole process takes less than 5 minutes. I am surprised that Maytag used such a flimsy handle assembly in their dishwashers since they are supposed to have the repair men with the most time on their hands. They probably sell just as many handle assemblies as they do dishwashers that have this particular part in it, probably more since you will probably have to change it 2 or 3 times during the life of the unit."

So in order to make sure that the fridge did not fall over, and to keep the installation point off the ground so that I could align the screw holes, I needed to shim up the side of the fridge that I was working on.To tap in the shims, I used a hammer and a spare chunk of wood. I ultimately used 3 shims, and kept tapping until the roller wheel could roll freely. Then I knew that the fridge was high enough. After that, it was pretty easy to remove the 4 screws, align the new bracket, and replace the screws. After that, in order to get the shims out I could just extend the foot brake as it was designed, and that lifted the fridge enough for me to easily slide out the shims. After that I just had to level out the fridge by adjusting the two feet."

He then removed the old start device from the compressor.  Plugged in the wire plug into the new start device, and pushed in the new start device into the compressor.

They work together to support and facilitate the smooth movement of your dishrack. The dishrack rollers are small wheels located on the sides of the dishrack and allow it to slide in and out effortlessly. Meanwhile, the dishrack adjuster is used to adjust the height via the selector at the back of this component. Over time, the rollers wear out. You may experience resistance or difficulty when sliding the dishrack in or out. If left unreplaced, your rollers or adjuster may break, causing dishes to tilt, collide, or fall over during the wash cycle. When removing a roller and adjuster from your appliance, you will need to pull out the dishrack partway. Detach the assembly by depressing the tabs on the two end stops before lifting them up. Keep in mind that the roller and adjuster are sold together, but the dishrack itself is sold separately.",

Now have new switches if the old ones ever wear out.  The latch assembly just pops out from what should be two sets of plastic peg clips molded into the black control panel back.  Mine were busted on one side.   So I molded some jb weld on the remaining sides to the pegs on the latch assembly and then screwed all back together (the controls on the panel are fine, not spending $85 if I can get away with sticking it...and the upper center two screws do the most of the holding anyway).  Works great again.  I really am ultra impressed with the HUGE difference in reinforcement that the new handle has.  If Maytag would have built it that way to begin with, should not have broke.  Anyway, if you are here just checking to see if you can do and how much parts are, place the order - it is no problem and cheap, and will probably never give up and break again."

If the impeller in the dishwasher is damaged or the motor has been shorted out and will not drain, it is possible the body is cracked, causing leakage. To prevent this from happening, replace the drain pump. The tools needed for this installation are: Phillips screwdriver, 5/16 inch nut driver, 5/8 inch wrench, and a flathead screwdriver. Remember to unplug your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this installation project. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions.",

You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this. And it will probably help to look at the new part closely so you can understand where the retainer clip is to press it and release the old pump.First remove the water from the dishwasher pan that would not drain with a wet/dry vac. Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done."

It is not the same as, nor functionally equivalent to, the old bracket that I assumed was broken, since it was not retaining the piece in the base of the door into which the cam is inserted to mount the door.  The new Cam is the correct part, but is not the solution since the old Cam is slightly worn but not damaged, and the thimble I bought does not seem to fit anywhere. The hole in the new bracket has a much too small hole to retain the Cam receptacle piece in place in the base of the door. However, this is the only lower door bracket shown in the PartSelect diagram of all the door parts used on a Whirlpool WRF560SMYM04 refrigerator. I do observe that the dark gray plastic cover on the base of the door is broken, but I don't imagine this plastic cover served to retain the Cam receptacle piece solidly in place, and this plastic cover is not offered as a replacement part either.  At present I am at a total loss for how to proceed!  However, the instructions for removing and replacing the door are clear and very easily carried out, and the job would be very quick and easy with the right parts. So beware if you are repairing the door on this model that the door parts diagram might not show all the parts to cover the door variations that apparently have been used!"

        "content": "First, I replaced the bottom door seal. You will need magnetic nut drivers because of the location of the 3/16 screws that hold the seal in place. you also need a 1/4 in nut driver to remove plastic cover that covers up the 5 3/16 screws. Last you need a small star driver to remove the door screws. Note 4 of the door screws, the 4 on top of the door are much longer than the side screws. With all this said, this seal was not my problem. I then replaced the large black rubber seal around the tub. Be sure if you do this you fold the seal in half and start in the middle of the top of the opening so you have the exact amount of seal left over on both sides. Also when you remove the old seal, clean the area it was removed from with a damp cloth. Turns out, That was not my problem either. So now I will move to the next step to see where the water is coming from but maybe this information will help someone with a simple door leak."

Looking through openings in the back panel of the freezer compartment, you could see the evaporator coils and fins were a solid chuck of ice.  There are three logical components to check.  Heater element, thermostat (located just above the evaporator) and a relay on the control board (located in the fridge control panel). Checked the heater with an ohm meter -- OK.  The thermostat closes the circuit at around 20 degrees and opens at around 32 degrees. Pulled out the thermostat, wiring, fan unit. Everything unplugs, unscrews, and unclips, don't cut wires. Put the whole assembly in a friends freezer for an hour or so to see if the thermostat closes -- OK.  Problem had to be with the control board.  Replaced control board, reprogrammed it per included instruction.  Everything is working again."

        "content": "I began by replacing the central light board by using a plastic non-marring wedge type tool slipping it between the housing and the retainers to release the latch like catch.  Then I removed the lightboard and light cover assembly by depressing the latch like retainers for the two wire connectors. Installation was as simple as snapping the wires into the connectors and then pushing the lightboard and light cover assembly into place.  One major note:  I learned from a repairman that you cannot resolve the problem by simply replacing the central lightboard.  you must replace all three lightboards, the two in the refrigerator and the one in the freezer because unless you can absolutely identify which board is causing the fault, it will continue to cause a problem on the main board and the lights will not work. Replacing the other two boards is the same as   the central board.  Additional comment to consider: I absolutely fail top see how this design of using three circuit boards for a simple light saves me anything; in fact after only 5 years it has cost me in excess of $400 (or 20% of the original cost of the unit) just in materials for a simple light--absurd, ridiculous design.  If it burns out again I will have an appliance repairman install a simple 1950's design switch a small LED bulb which will probably last longer than the unit."

If the drip tray is damaged, you may notice that your refrigerator is leaking. Because it is made of plastic, the drip tray can eventually develop a crack. You will need to pull out the refrigerator from the wall, and take off the bottom panel on the back of your refrigerator in order to access the drip tray for replacement. This is an OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.",

The metal panel is on the left side underneath the refrigerator and the evaporation tray is resting on the panel.  I removed 4 screws that were holding the metal panel, pressed down on the panel, slid out the old, cracked plastic evaporation tray, inserted the new plastic evaporation tray, raised the metal panel to its original position, replaced the 4 screws, being careful not to pinched the water line that feeds the ice-maker.  VOILA!  Un-tilt the frig and re-stock it.  It took a day for the temperature to stabilize, due to tilting, I think.  New tray $45."

This allowed easy, direct access to the motor (that was the hard, messy part). From this point it was easy. Unplug the wiring, remove the retaining bolt, rotate the motor off the mounting brackets and pull it out. Then put the new one in. That was the easy part (about 15 minutes). The entire job took 2-and-a-half hours, most of which was taken in disconnecting, cleaning up and reconnecting the dishwasher. It's much quieter now."

If your dryer will not start, will not tumble, or is noisy during operation, the idler pulley wheel may need to be replaced. This part is located beneath the drum of the dryer, so the drum will need to be removed before you can access the idler pulley wheel. It is also recommended to remove the blower housing and motor from the dryer itself, for easier access to the idler pulley wheel. It is connected by a set of two 5/16 screws. This two-inch-wide idler pulley wheel is beige or black in color and is made of plastic. This pulley wheel comes with its own metallic bearing in its center. Be sure to shut off power to the dryer before beginning this repair.",

Pulled the lower panel off (2 bolts), then the door (2 bolts). Marked the door switch wires. Took 2 bolts out of the top & tilted it back. I found this the easiest way to access the drum. Mark 2 wires before disconnecting them from the top.  All bolts are 5/16\". Removed the plastic piece that connects the lint trap to the blower (3 screws). Have to access these from inside the drum. Removed the belt, then the drum. The bad roller was the belt tension roller. Can't get to the snap ring from the front of the dryer for this roller. The 2 rollers in the back you can get to without removing the drum completely. Very easy to replace all rollers with the drum out. Also very easy to re-assemble. Buy or borrow a good set of snap ring pliers. Make sure you diagram the proper belt route if you don't have a picture. I printed a picture off this web site. Have someone hold the drum up so you can get the belt on, otherwise the entire repair is a 1 person job. Went back together in about 10 minutes. Total cost $40.00 parts & shipping."

It is a flexible rubber strip that runs along the edge of the appliance door. It creates an airtight seal between the door and cabinet to prevent cold air from escaping, and warm air from entering the refrigerator, to ensure that the temperature in the appliance remains constant. Over time, the door gasket can lose its elasticity or tear. In this case, you will likely notice frost build-up, increased noise, and inconsistent temperatures. Peel the faulty gasket off the refrigerator frame and remove any debris or residue on the surface. Carefully place the new seal along the edge of the door and press it firmly into place. Secure it with the appropriate fasteners and close the door to verify that there are no gaps between the door and cabinet.",

        "content": "The old gasket was obviously gapping, partially from age and partially from damage during a move.  To make the repair, I loosened the screws that are under the gasket and hold it in, but did not remove them.  Once all were loose, I removed the old gasket, then starting at the top, ran a thin bead of food grade RTV under the portion of the door that captures the gasket.  I put the sealant on that edge only, then carefully worked one of the short edges of the gasket under the plastic and tightened all but the corner screws.  I then ran the RTV down the inside of the hinge side of the door and repeated the process, this time tightening the top screw and the hinge side screw at the top, but leaving the bottom most screw loose.  I repeated the process on the opening side of the door.  The bottom was the hardest because the gasket seemed just a little long and it was hard to get the RTV up and behind the door portion, but after a couple tried I got a good bead of sealant then slid the gasket under the door capture and tightened all the remaining screws.  After closing the door, it was obvious that there were places were it did not seal well.  I used some cardboard strips, cut from the box the gasket came in, to place inside the freezer, between the hard plastic of the door and the inside of the gasket where it laps over the screws.  This helped a lot, but there were still a couple small areas, so I used more cardboard, from the outside, between the main portion of the gasket and the rim of the gasket.  This eliminated all the gaps.  I let this sit overnight and this morning removed all the cardboard for a great sealing freezer."

However the problem was replacing the beach gasket that prevents the water from flowing out of the dishwasher tub. The door had to be unhinged from the dishwasher which was unscrewed from the cabinets and brought out from its location. After the door was completely removed it was laid on its front.  After removing the door hinges which were secured with just one bolt I tried to slide the back panel off the front panel but without any success.  So I had to remove the torn and worn out gasket while working in a tight space. This is where the problem rose because according to  installation instructions there are screws supposed to be holding it to the main body frame. However, in my case rivets were used  by the manufacture since this was the first time the gasket was being replaced. So I had to use a power tool With a grinding bit to remove the face of the rivets and essentially cut them out to reveal the underlying holes. After this I replace the beach gasket and then used half inch SS Philips bolts and nuts to secure the gasket to the body frame."

        "content": "The dishwasher was not heating anymore. I suspected it was the float/flood switch, so I got that ordered. I went ahead and ordered the element also and I'm glad I did! Even though the element was good, when I tested it I loosened the nut holding the element in. When I retightened it there was NO WAY for me to get it watertight again and it kept dripping out the bottom. Mine was made in 2019, and the gaskets on the element that came with it were a terrible design - the metal flange on the element was about as big as the hole in the middle of the gasket so water just leaked between the gasket \"donut\" hole and the element with no way to seal.  The element I bought for this repair just in case had a totally redesigned gasket that sealed right up and didn't have the same design issue.  So beware, if you are fiddling with the element in your process, be sure the gasket will reseal - or just have an extra new element in case it is the old (bad) design.The flood switch was easy to find (with dishwasher on its back) in a white housing under the black circular sump.Getting the actual switch out of that housing took some doing. I ended up using 4 small kebab sticks - toothpicks might work better- all 4 tabs have to be pulled out at the same time. So I ended up changing out both the element (which was good but started leaking) and the float switch. IMPORTANT!!! Before you put the dishwasher back in, you probably need to reset the thermal cutoff (TCO) on the back of the dishwasher.  Follow the wire up from the element and it is the first thing it goes to. There should be a small (3mm) black button that has popped out. Press that back in.  With your repair (float switch or element) it should start heating again - at least mine did."

It is responsible for catching small food particles, debris, and other items that are washed off dishes during the cleaning process. The filter stops these particles from clogging the drain hose and other internal components thereby preventing damage to the dishwasher, maintaining a clear flow of water, and reducing unpleasant odors. The filter also prevents the debris from recirculating onto the clean dishes. You can find the dishwasher filter at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is recommended to clean the filter thoroughly every 3 to 6 months.",

This pressure sensor, also known as a pressure switch, is designed to monitor the water pressure, communicate with the control board of the dishwasher, and accurately calculate the necessary amount of water for the washing cycle. If this pressure sensor is bad or not working properly, it will cause over and underfilling of your dishwasher, as well as excessive noise while in operation. To replace this pressure sensor, you will need a screwdriver and wrench to gain access and remove this part, and further disassembly of your dishwasher may be required.

He was going to charge me $389 to install the part and they were over charging for the part. The repairman suggested I just get a new dishwasher.I ordered the part from the website at 1/2 the price that the other place charges and found it on line. With the step by step instructions and the online  page, I successfully installed it MYSELF. Saved me a ton of $$.I LOVE the websiteThank You!!!!"

I then disconnected the release lock mechanism for the filter and finally removed the water-filter base. I did the reverse to install the new water-filter base. Previously I had tested the intake water line and noticed the water was flowing with enough pressure upto the water-filter's base but no water was exiting thru the outflow line, which leads to the Ice-Maker and Dispenser. I had tried changing the filter but that didn't solve the problem it was then I had realized that the Base was the problem. The actual problem was the spring-loaded valves for both the intake and outflow lines, which had a plastic prong that protrudes out of the base that is triggered by the filter when installed. The two prongs were worn-down so the filter wasn't activating the spring-loaded release valve to let the water thru. As for the light, I just unscrewed it."

The solenoid had stopped working, so it would not automatically close the door flap.  I read some posts on this site that suggest that you had to remove the trim around the entire dispenser to get at the solenoid.  My fridge may be a newer model, but in any event it was much easier than that.  Just below the touch pad for choosing water, ice, or crushed ice (above where the ice/water dispenses) there are three very small holes spaced about an inch a part. After unplugging the fridge, I stuck a small philips-head screw driver in each, freeing spring clips. That  allowed the touch pad to come off.  I then removed four screws to remove a plastic piece covering the chute, giving me access to the flap and solenoid.  I just unplugged the solenoid from the circuit board on the back of the touch pad and then removed three screws to remove the old solenoid. I replaced it with the new solenoid and plugged it into the circuit board. The touch pad then snapped back into place.The hardest part was figuring out how to get at the solenoid.  After I found that pushing the clips in those three holes allowed me to remove the touch pad, it could not be any easier."

Just unplug fridge, yank that water spill tray out, yes yank, it's a bit hard to do that if you've not done it before.  After that remove the 3 phillips head screws you just gained access to.  Lift panel frame up then out.  Disconnect wire harness plug and set that frame aside.  Take out next screws exposed  to free the unit.  Tilt unit out and remove the two little screws and shims holding actuator in place.  Remove broken one.  Put new one in.  Reverse all actions taken thus far.  Plug fridge back in and have a drink of water like nothing ever happened. : )  You can do this!"

        "content": "Unplugged refrigerator.  Pull forward on tray at bottom of water & ice dispenser to remove it.  Remove three screws.  Push up and then pull out to remove black cover around dispensers.  Be careful not to break ribbon cable.  Pulled ribbon cable from green circuit card on the cover.  Set the cover aside.  Removed green circuit card from refigerator (six small screws).  Had to unplug two wires to do this.  Set this aside.  Make sure you remember which connector each wire goes in for re-assembly.  I ended up removing the entire assembly, it was easier to work on.  There were a couple more screws to remove and then you can carefully pull the entire assembly down and toward you to remove it.  This meant removing the water supply line from the dispenser.  Pushed up on the water supply line with needle nose pliers to \"unstick\" it and make it easier to pull out.  Used needle nose pliers to unplug wires from broken actuator from the circuit card.  Make sure to unplug the correct one.  Unscrewed the two screws that held the metal plates thet held the actuator in place.  Cut the wires to make it easier to remove the broken actuator and pull the wires through  Installed the new actuator and screws.  Routed the wire through and plugged it in to the circuit card.  Now the hardest part, and I would not have figured it out without a tip from this website.  There was no slack in the water line and it was impossible to push the end of it back into the hole in the dispenser assembly.  Open the refrigerator doors and remove the black cover at the bottom.  The water line goes up through the freezer door from the bottom.  It was easy to push an inch or two of slack up through the door.  Then I could grab the water line and insert it in the hole in the dispenser.  Re-connect the wires that were disconnected and replace the assembly in the freezer door.  You can pull slack in the water supply line back down from the bottom if needed.  Replace the screws that hold the dispenser assembly in place.  Replace the circuit card.  Then I had to push the ribbon cable back into the slot in the circuit card in the cover.  I had to remove the circuit card from the cover to get at the slot.  Push the cable into the slot and re-install the circuit card in the cover.  I needed to have my son help me here as a second set of hands was needed, the ribbon cable is short.  Replace the cover, be careful not to damage the ribbon cable.  Install the three screws and snap the boittom tray back  in place.  Re-install the black cover at the bottom.  Works great."

      "description": "Refrigerator Water Filter ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 16 Reviews PartSelect Number PS16217433 Manufacturer Part Number XWFE This water filter is found in the rear upper-right corner of the interior of the refrigerator. If your model has a replacement indicator light it will turn red to signal the need for a replacement. If your model does not have an indicator light, the filter cartridge should be replaced every six months or earlier if you notice a decrease in the flow of water from the dispenser. The filter media is carbon black and reduces leads, some pharmaceuticals, and fifty other contaminates. It is 2 inches deep, 6 inches high, 2.25 inches wide and weighs approximately 1 lbs. When it comes time to replace the filter, first discard the old one by turning it to the left to remove. It will release itself when it has been turned far enough. Installation instructions are quick and simple but can vary slightly depending on if it is a bottom-freezer, side-by-side or multi-door bottom-freezer model. Refer to the user instructions for you filter. Do not forget to reset the filter change indicator if applicable. In bottom-freezer and side-by-side models this is done by pressing and holding the RESET WATER FILTER bottom for three seconds. On a multi-door bottom-freezer model, press the button underneath the Confirm Filter Change message while the water is dispensing. On select models this reset is done automatically once a new filter is installed.",

Parts guy credits my account and says better go directly to GE.  Wait 10 days for GE, for this part and once again same odd looking pump with wrong electrical plug. My son who is a welder by trade asks me if there is a packet of parts in carton and yes there is.  He says that perhaps there is a converter for the electrical.

It also helps to absorb the noise and vibrations created while the dishwasher is running. Over time the gasket may wear down, tear, or fall off due to exposure to heat and chemicals.

It's held in by a small nut that requires about a 4\" extension to reach. (You may be able to unscrew the nut with small needle-nose pliers). Just unscrew and take out the unit - the unit functions just to keep the ice maker wiring in place. 3) The wiring looks a mess, but there's just one wiring connector to the ice maker assembly. Unsnap it. The ice maker is not screwed in, it just slides in -- reach in and pull the assembly straight out; when it stops, lower it a bit and it will come free.

This part is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. Minerals and sediments can build up over time and cause a blockage in your inlet valve. They can also cause the valve to stick open, leading to an overflow of water. If this part is malfunctioning, water flow to your appliance could be compromised. Check for small ice cubes or a lack of ice cubes/water, as this is an obvious sign the part is damaged. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. Test your water inlet valve with a multimeter. You can test both the water dispenser side and the ice maker side. The part measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.75 inches wide and is constructed of plastic and metal.

        "title": "Refrigertor water dispenser not working BUT ice machine is working",
        "content": "The very first symptom here is important!  The door water dispenser is not working but the ice macine is working.  You may only have a frozen water tube in the door so do the following before diagnosing that your solenoid valve is bad: 1) the tube usually runs under the front of the refrigerator and usually has a quick disconnect.  Undo the connection and press the dispenser.  If water comes out of the tube you have a frozen or blocked tube in the door.  2) Immediately adjust the temperature in the freezer and warm the freezer compartment as much as you can without destroying the freezer contents.  Wait 24 hours.  This will usually unfreeze the line.  Do not waste your time with a hair dryer.  NOW, if this doesn't work and you are convinced you need to order and replace the solenoid, follow these steps. Assemble your tools first.  I needed a good ratchet set and a screwdriver.  A shop towel is helpful for spilled water.  A light is handy.  Pull out the refreigerator to gain access to the rear of the unit.  Unplug the power and close the water valve (older homes, you may need to actually shut the house water supply).  Remove the screws which hold the cover over the lower half of the refrigerator.  On the left you will see the solenoid.  It's always good to see that your new part matches the one you feel needs replaced.  They may not match perfectly due to changing design but they should be very similar.  One screw holds this part in place and access is very simple.  Now simply unplug the electrical connections.  In my case, one blue \"blade\" type connection (powering the water)  and one red \"blade\" type connection powering the ice maker.  They are not the same size and this coupled with the coloring means you will not accidently switch them.  pull the tubes clear of the solenoid.  This is simple and needs no explantion.  Grab your new solenoid and reattach both the electrical and water lines (two, remember, ice maker and drink dispencer).  Replace the single screw.  Re-attach the rear, lower refrigerator cover and go to the front of the unit to check the water.  You can listen carefully and hear the power engage from the new part bringing you water.  Clean up, replace the refrigerator back to its place and  look really tired when your wife sees that you worked \"so hard\"!  You probably saved at least $50-$80 from a service call which can now be used to take the family to dinner after your \"exhausting\" 15 minute workout of removing about 10 screws and wheeling the unit in and out of place.  Writing this article took longer!  My 4 year old worked harder holding the flash light!"

I removed the heating element and saw that even though there were washers on the ends that protruded through the backside of the machine, they really weren't sealing the holes the element was sticking through.  Looking at YouTube videos on the installation procedure, I noticed the element being installed had a sort of metal grommet permanently affixed to each end and the rubber washers were between the grommet and the dishwasher body.  I ordered the new part and saw this to be when I received the new part.  This grommet allowed the washer to seal the hole, once the plastic nuts were installed on the backside of the dishwasher.  This seems to have stopped the leak.  I don't know how the original part ever worked correctly, since the washers freely sat on the element with nothing to force them up against the body of the dishwasher and seal the holes. It may have been leaking long before I discovered the problem."

Upon removal of the valve, check I discovered hair wrapped around it which compromised the MO31 packing and caused the leak. I probably could have just cleaned out the hair and reassembled it but because my installation is a bit of a pain I elected to change the case assy (because of a slight depression where the packing sets) the M031 packing, the MO25 valve, check, and the MO35 pump gasket. After that was accomplished I turned the machine upside down and replaced the MO26 diverter motor and reinstalled the dishwasher.

The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub.

It did not close properly and led to an overflow of water inside that eventually spilled into the pan underneath the unit.I see now why the pump keeps running after this error.  In this case, it would have led to a big flood in the kitchen if it did not.I was actually able to run the unit while broke by manually operating the valve under our sink that provides water to the unit.Be sure to turn off breaker before servicing.  Don't get shocked!Be sure to turn off water before starting!  Or, you'll have a flood.Anyway, I just pulled the unit out (was secured by 2 screws on the sides). I lifted up the insulation material on the left side to get at the valve.  Pushed a little green tab to release the electrical plug.  Then, use pliers to move clamp off the white water hose on the inside.  Then, pull of white hose.  This was hard in my case.  Took a lot of force.  Then, reach behind the unit and use pliers to unscrew water hose.  Now, the whole gray panel there can pop out with some force.  Then, slip the old valve out and slip new one in.  Reconnect hoses and clamp.  Note that I put some caulk on the connector where white hose goes.  Not sure if needed or not.Good luck!"

Partselect help me select the correct valve.The key was the valve body, the unloader valve inserts into the valve body. There are two types of valve bodies, a 4 bolt and a 5 bolt. They look the same but do not interchange. I needed the 4 bolt.I was nervous as the new unloader valve was a different construction than my old valve. It worked perfectly.Replacement was easy.Locate the unloader valve. It is part of the pump body. You can recognize it by the spring extending out from the valve body.Remove the “U” shaped clip that holds the unloader valve in the valve body. I used pliers to grab the spring and pulled the unloader valve from the valve body. It took a little pulling pressure to remove.Note the orientation of the unloader valve I. The valve body. You want to install the unloader valve with the same orientation.It may take a little force to seat the valve. I used a little silicone grease to lube the valve. A small tap on the end of the valve to insure it is fully seated. It has to be seated so the “U” shaped retaining clip can be inserted to hold the unloader valve in place. Again, a light tap was necessary to fully seat the clip.That was it, I was back operating my pressure washer"

Slide toward the bottom, the inner door panel off from the outer door panel. You will see the door wire harness and some styrofoam insulation. Stand with outer door facing away from you. Remove UI by holding door handle, pressing it and pull the control head, up and away from you. It should come off from the top off the outer door panel. The UI will need to be removed from this housing. Unplug the UI harness connector. Remove 7 screw with a Phillips screwdriver or 1/4 socket.

Reattach the connector pug to the new UI board. My personality was factory set. So, no jumper  pins on my board. Snap the UI housing back onto the top of your door. Delicately, remove the styrofoam and unsnap the old harness to the soap and drying dispenser. Remove the rest of the old harness. Install the new door harness and use the plastic plugs on the harness to secure to the door. Install the styrofoam insulation.  Attach the inner door panel to the outer door panel by sliding inner pan up toward the top. Replace the 2 screws at the bottom of the door. Attach vent cap by hand screwing it on. Position door at the dishwasher. Use Allen wrench or helper to hold at correct angle. Use a vise grip to grab the plastic pulley to attach it to the door hinge. Do the same on the other side. Plug in the harness connector to the PC board. Plug in the dishwasher and the UI should light up!  Run a load and make sure no leaks are seen around the door. Replace toe kick."

The people at Part Select were helpful and together we looked at the schematic which did, indeed, seem to show a box sticking up from the circuit board. A YouTube video showed me how to take the door off its hinges, unscrew 4 screws and slide the inside of the door upwards. The circuit board went in fairly easily. There was space for the LED (even though it still doesn't show through the top) and now the lights work."

Also checked at the drain hose/disposal joint and there was no blockage. After removing the bottom panels I noticed the solenoid was shot. Cylinder was burnt up and stuck solid in the up position. I went online and found that a main cause of this can be from the timer causing the solenoid to over exert and burn out. I decided if I was going to order parts and dig into a repair I should replace both. For the timer it is just a matter of unscrewing the inner door panel and unplugging the old timer. Then inserting new one. Couple of things I ran into were the door is no longer heavy enough to stay down so I grabbed a waffle iron as a weight to hold it down. Also will need to unscrew the set screw on the Door lock latch's bottom side. Pay close attention to how it was together helps. For the solenoid I removed the main screws holding the unit in place as well as the c-clip holding the plastic arm. Undo the spring and plug and the whole unit comes out. Reverse these steps with the new solenoid to install."

      "description": "Dishwasher LOWER SPRAY ARM ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 31 Reviews PartSelect Number PS17137081 Manufacturer Part Number WD22X33499 This lower spray arm assembly in your dishwasher distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle by spinning around and spraying water in different directions. You can usually find it attached to a support or hub at the bottom of the dishwasher. If this part is broken, you might notice some signs. You might hear a knocking or banging sound coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may not rotate properly or might seem wobbly. It is important to replace a damaged arm assembly as your dishes will not get cleaned properly, and they will still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. It can also cause the dishwasher to have a bad smell because of leftover food residue. To remove your existing arm assembly, you will need to release its locking mechanism before lifting it out of your appliance. Please be informed that this OEM-verified part is sold individually.",

Push them in; pry up top cover with small flathead screwdriver. Slide white top cover up and you will now see the metal blades and assembly. Auger is held in place with a metal c-clip and washer on the end. Use flat head screwdriver to pry off c-clip. Then you will see a nylon round slotted nut. The threads are reverse, use pliers and loosen nut. It is not that tight but pliers are needed. Then it all is loose and ready for removal. I slid all the blades off at one time and kept them stacked together. Slide out auger and clear flat shield cover. Install new auger, clear shield, and metal blade stack. When you put it all back together take a look at the long metal J-hook on the bottom make sure it is in the slot before you make everything tight.

This sensor is compatible with various makes and models of refrigerator and is sold as an individual part. This sensor works with the electronic control board within your refrigerator to control the temperature by turning the compressor on or off. If your fridge is too warm or too cold, consider changing the thermistor with this genuine OEM part, and make sure to disconnect the power to the refrigerator before doing any repairs.",

Thermistor was the only thing it could be. Took all my shelves out. Removed four screws. Took the back panel off. The thermistor sits tucked in on the side. I piped it out, in clipped it. Used my multimeter to test the numbers. Numbers were off just a bit. Ordered the part. Crossed my fingers.,took less then 5 minutes to put the part in. Plugged in the fridge. It was sitting at 33 degrees in about an hour and a half. I can’t believe I fixed it. I knew NOTHING about refrigerators. For how big my fridge is, it would have cost 3,000 and up to get a new one with the same cu ft size. Instead, it cost me $44. That includes shipping. Thank you Parts Select!! Made it so easy to pick the correct part for my model fridge!"

        "content": "There was an accidental spill which seeped through the water-hose feed hole in the bottom of the fridge. The liquid had dripped down onto the Starter and Run Capacitor and shorted them out. I called an applicance repair shop to possibly get it fixed. They estimated around $500 with the service call, parts and labor. Not a chance was they getting that from me. So I unhooked the retaining wired and removed the burnt parts. I then looked up the part numbers and ordered the 2 parts I needed from Parts Select for $50 bucks including shipping. In just two days my order arrived. I installed the 2 parts the same way and as easily as I took them out. Now my fridge is running good as new.  When my HUSBAND returned home from work he was stunned to see that I had done the repair without his help. He laughed and said, \"Yep. You da' woman!\"Mrs. S.Queens, NY"

The condenser fan motor had seized and I thought this is something even I can replace.I did a Google search on the refrigerator model number. The link to your site looked promising and I clicked on it. I was taken to your web page for my refrigerator and I clicked on the schematic for the condenser assembly.The schematic had the parts I needed labeled clearly so this layman could be sure to get the right ones.I ordered the parts at 12:45PM Monday and selected overnight shipping. The parts arrived at 8:35AM Tuesday (Thank you FedEx). I installed the parts and my refrigerator is up and running again.To get to the condenser fan motor I took off the back panel on the fridge that covers the condenser, fan and coil. The fan/motor assembly is attached to a bracket I removed with two screws. Pulled the bracket assembly out of the back of the fridge, removed the fan blade and then the motor, and put the new motor on the bracket and stuck the new fan blade on the motor spindle. The trickiest part was getting the complete assembly back in. Just went slowly and took my time. Reconnected the wires,  no problems. I took pictures of everything that I disassembled BEFORE I disassembled it in case I wasn't sure how something went back in but this job was so simple I didn't need the pictures.I’m not sure how I could improve on this except maybe you could ship a refrigerator technician, too, to do the install.Thank you PartSelect everything worked out better than I could have hoped and I saved $220.00 compared to what a repair service was quoting."

I had a single element heater, and the replacement was a double element, the directions even explained how to rearrange the wires to make it work. The whole job only really consisted of cutting two wires that are color coded on the thermostat and resplicing the new ones in. I used scotch locks and electrical tape for the splices. The element had connectors on it so I just removed two screws, unplugged two wires and plugged them on the new one.The greatest thing about this repair was that I troubleshot the problem using the PartSelect website, ordered the parts and they arrived at my house in less than 24 hours.Thank You."

With the tab broken, the round door would not shut to seal the freezer chute and dispensing water would spatter everywhere.

It can be located in either the freezer compartment near the evaporator coils or in the fresh food compartment near the airflow channels, depending on the model. If you notice issues like excessive icing in the freezer, inadequate cooling in the refrigerator, temperature fluctuations, or error messages on the display panel, it indicates a potential problem with the thermistor. Since your fridge will not be able to maintain the desired temperature, this results in food spoilage, inefficient cooling, and potential damage to the cooling components. To replace the thermistor, disconnect it from the connector plug or wiring harness and remove any mounting brackets or clips using a screwdriver if necessary. Remember to consult your user manual to determine the required number of thermistors, as they are sold individually as OEM replacement parts.",

I warmed them up first by applying a dampened cloth heated in the microwave to make them a little more pliable.A good push of the new unit towards the snap-ins along with some upward force will get it stable.Reattach the metal screw in bracket & connect the wiring harness to rear plug... and don't forget to plug the whole thing back in.It will take awhile for the first batch of cubes dump as the timer may need to cycle completely around to get to the fill cycle... be patient.Dump the first couple of batches of cubes just to make sure you're free of any residue."

The flat face of the gasket has an internal magnetic strip that helps keep the seal tight against the steel face of the refrigerator. Installation requires no tools. This is the basic process:1) Unbox the new gasket and get it ready to install so you don't have to leave the fridge open too long.2) Open the door and grab the old gasket at one of the corners and pull away. This will unseat the barbed ridge I mentioned above. Work your way around the door until the whole gasket is free.3) Set aside the old gasket4) Grab a moistened paper towel and wipe down the (now exposed) sealing surface of the fridge and door. 5) Align the new gasket in the door and start pushing the barb into place. I found that the new gasket seemed slightly oversize compared to the original, so it took a little tweaking. What worked for me was to get all the corners seated, then work my way around the door making sure the gasket is fully seated.6) Once you have the new gasket installed, close the door to make sure everything fits OK.7) Open the door again and run your finger along the inside edge of the gasket seal. What you want to do is fold the edge of the gasket down so it lays flat against the outer wall of the door. 8) Shut the door and look from the sides and top to try to spot any gaps. You should be able to poke the gasket from the side and get the magnet strips to click into place. It seems like after a day or so the gasket 'relaxed' and I didn't have to worry about this anymore.9) Dispose of the old gasket. I was able to pull the gasket into four pieces (separating at the corners) so it would fit in my city trash can..."

It is specially designed to secure the mullion in refrigerators, allowing it to pivot and ensure smooth door movement. The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually.",

This white, OEM part measures roughly 1 inch in diameter and can be used for the front and the rear support, as designed by the manufacturer, and mounts to the inside cabinet wall. Replacing this part is an easy repair, and will require a small flat blade screwdriver, a putty knife, and a soft hammer. Remove the crisper and shelf from the refrigerator before replacing the support. The crisper cover front support is held in place with a locking pin. To remove the old part, you will first need to push the pin into the interior of the cabinet using the screwdriver, and then you can pull the support out with a putty knife. If you cannot get the pin out you can use a flat-blade screwdriver to push it down and out of sight and it will not harm anything in your refrigerator After removing the pin and attaching the new support, simply use the soft hammer to lock the new pin in place.",

He said to put the new gasket in the dryer,  while I removed the old one, to make it pliable and aid in sealing. I pulled the old gasket out of the retainer clip, cleaned around the area and snapped the new gasket into place(push the  raised part into the groove). The repairman said that food residue, especially at the bottom, caused a sticky glue-like film to form. He also advised to put smear vaseline on the new gasket and wipe it off to leave a film. This would aid in sealing and keeping new the gasket from sticking."

If you find the dish rack is causing the door to not close properly, it may be due to the part being worn out or damaged. All you need to complete this repair is a small flat blade screw driver. Simply pop out the cap with a smaller flat-blade screwdriver and snap the new one into place. If the rear cap needs to be replaced you will need to remove both front caps and slide the rack completely off for full access. It is important to note that this part is sold individually, and more than one may be required, depending on your repair. An inexpensive part, it can be a good idea to purchase several at a time to have on-hand when needed.",

I decided to try replacing the least expensive parts first. First I tried the defrost themostat, it was a very easy repair. My coil still froze up after a couple of days. Then I learned how to force my fridge into a defrost mode (on a frigidaire you just click the light button in the fridge 5 times in under 6 seconds). Then I noticed that the defrost heater was not heating up...this repair was more difficult. You have to first remove the two shelves, bin, and tracks. Then you remove the back panel...4 screws. Then you have to take out a couple of screws and drill out one rivet on the drain pan and pull the drain pan out so you can get the defrost heater which snakes up through the coil from the bottom of the coil. Be careful, as the drain pan and coil fins are very sharp, I sliced a couple fingers messing around with these parts. The defrost heater itself is relatively easy to put in once the coil is in the right position (there are videos on youtube on how to do this). After I put in the new heating element, and buttoned everything back up, I was excited to check my work...I forced the fridge into defrost by clicking the light switch 5 times, and the heater still didn't come on! It dawned on me that this problem started about 5 days after a major power outage (hurricane Irene)...When the power came on, it must have surged, and zapped the defrost control board...Long story short, I replaced the control board (about $75.00 from partselect.com) and my problem is fixed...at least I have a 100% brand new defrost system now...Of course it won't be too long until my wife wants another fridge to match her Stainless Steel applicances...oh well, this one will do fine in the garage."

Pulled the dishwasher out, turned it over, and was able to easily replace the motor and pump assembly. The drain tube was also an easy replace. A couple key notes:1. I also purchased a new drain solenoid and impeller kit. Note that both of these items are already included in the Motor and Pump kit replacement. There is no need to by both, now I have extras.2. The end of the drain tube has to be trimmed if you are routing the drain tube to an air gap mounted on your kitchen sink. You have to cut the large diameter end of the tube to get to the narrow portion that will fit on your air gap.3. The first cycle you run with the new motor/pump assembly is noisy. When you first fire it up the components in the pump are all dry, and they squeal until the water gets to them. I initially thought I had done something wrong, but once the water started flowing all the peculiar sounds cleared up."

The solenoid had stopped working, so it would not automatically close the door flap.  I read some posts on this site that suggest that you had to remove the trim around the entire dispenser to get at the solenoid.  My fridge may be a newer model, but in any event it was much easier than that.  Just below the touch pad for choosing water, ice, or crushed ice (above where the ice/water dispenses) there are three very small holes spaced about an inch a part. After unplugging the fridge, I stuck a small philips-head screw driver in each, freeing spring clips. That  allowed the touch pad to come off.  I then removed four screws to remove a plastic piece covering the chute, giving me access to the flap and solenoid.  I just unplugged the solenoid from the circuit board on the back of the touch pad and then removed three screws to remove the old solenoid. I replaced it with the new solenoid and plugged it into the circuit board. The touch pad then snapped back into place.The hardest part was figuring out how to get at the solenoid.  After I found that pushing the clips in those three holes allowed me to remove the touch pad, it could not be any easier."

If this was the problem, the coils will be iced over and need thawed.  Either time or a hair dryer...6.  The thermostats clip onto the copper tubing, simply pull them off, keeping close attention to the color of the wires.7.  Be very careful touching the bottom of the coils as the defrost conductor coils are along the bottom and encased in easily breakable glass.  If you need to replace this as well, remove the center brace (wire)by pulling towards you and then down.  remove wire attachments at both ends and rotate coil out of end braces.8.  Replacing thermostats...you must CUT the wires, and attach new thermostats with wire couplers or wire nuts and then wrap with electrical tape that is rated for the cold.9.  Re-attach all parts and replace back wall and coverings.10.  Enjoy!"

The trouble shooting that outher's had done was the same as mine, I descovered that the coil's in the freezer had frozen up complety. They are located behind a plasic cover in the freezer area, it had frozen up due to the Defrost heater element being defective, when i took it out it was black and burnt looking,It is located at the bottom edge of the coils,2 bolt's and a plug in on each side. That is probally the only part i needed but i went ahead and replaced the sensor and timer also.The sensor wires in the freezer( located on the very top of the coils) had to be cut and the new ones spliced in, only 2 wires and easy access. I also put shrink wrap on the splices to protect them from mosisture. The timer was located in the fridge area by the temp. control knobs. 2 small bolts and a plug in was all on it. It's been 5 day's and so far so good. The worst part was defrosting the frozen coils. This was done with the wife's hair dryer and a couple towel's to soak up the water. Don't just let the water go down the drain hole because the tray that catches it will not hold all the water from the frozen coil's. Just a reminder, don't forget to unplug the unit when working on it. Hope this help's and was very easy install, Cost about $125 in part's and a couple hours of labor(did a good cleaning while it was eampty for the repair) Good luck."

The trouble shooting that outher's had done was the same as mine, I descovered that the coil's in the freezer had frozen up complety. They are located behind a plasic cover in the freezer area, it had frozen up due to the Defrost heater element being defective, when i took it out it was black and burnt looking,It is located at the bottom edge of the coils,2 bolt's and a plug in on each side. That is probally the only part i needed but i went ahead and replaced the sensor and timer also.The sensor wires in the freezer( located on the very top of the coils) had to be cut and the new ones spliced in, only 2 wires and easy access. I also put shrink wrap on the splices to protect them from mosisture. The timer was located in the fridge area by the temp. control knobs. 2 small bolts and a plug in was all on it. It's been 5 day's and so far so good. The worst part was defrosting the frozen coils. This was done with the wife's hair dryer and a couple towel's to soak up the water. Don't just let the water go down the drain hole because the tray that catches it will not hold all the water from the frozen coil's. Just a reminder, don't forget to unplug the unit when working on it. Hope this help's and was very easy install, Cost about $125 in part's and a couple hours of labor(did a good cleaning while it was eampty for the repair) Good luck."

My husband says it has to go through its cycle.  It works on a 24 hour timer.  My refrigerator is working fine and this has saved me alot of money.  My husband says, once you put on the timer you may have to use a flat screwdriver and turn the small dial clockwise one click to start it.  He removed the kick grill and replaced the part.  Dont forget to shut breaker off to replace this part. Turn power back on and start the timer.  We are so happy that we now have a working refrigerator."

This is a safety mechanism to ensure that there are no unsafe buildups of gas inside your appliance. The coils are attached to the dryer gas valve. If the dryer does not heat or heats intermittently, the coil may not be opening the gas valve. Both coils must be operational for the valve to open. No continuity would indicate a defective coil, but they can be intermittent and fail when they get hot. Both coils should be replaced when one of them is broken. This part can break as a result of material fatigue from normal use. This part measures approximately 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch in height, and is constructed of plastic and metal.

        "content": "1. Removed lint screen and holder frame. Unplugged the electrical cord and closed the gas valve in the line before it goes into the dryer.2. Removed two bolts at bottom front of machine and took off the bottom front panel.3. Removed three bolts from black plastic exit vent and took it out to give more room to access everything.4. removed two wires and  screws on the limit thermostat. Did the reverse to place the new one.5. Removed wires (remembering placement), then holder screw. rotated the Gas Dryer Sensor counter clockwise to release the bottom tab so the sensor can be taken off the flame tube. Did the reverse to place the new one on.6. Removed the one screw on the gas/flame tube that holds the bracket and igniter inside the flame tube. Removed the wires fro the igniter (remember placement) Slid the whole assembly toward the back of the machine to get the tube off the gas valve then rotated the whole assembly counter-clocwise to release the tab on the left side of the bracket. This was a little tight and had to work with it a bit to get the tab out and slide the whole piece out of the flame tube.7. Once the tube and igniter were out i removed the scree that holds the igniter and replaced with the new one. Made sure no dust, etc. was in the piece.8. Did the reverse to place the tube/igniter back into the flame tube.9. Carefully  and forcefully removed the wire connectors to the two coils. These were tough to get off. Removed the two screws that hold the bracket that holds the two coils in place. Slid the coils off the spindles remembering which one has the two wire connection and which one has the three wire connection and the way they went on. Replaced the old with the new. Placed the bracket onto the new coils and made sure the little bumps on the top are in the holes in the bracket. Tightened the screws to hold the coil bracket. Reattached the wire connectors to the coils making sure they go ALL the way back on. 10. Vaccumed everything I could to get lint, dust, etc. out. 11.Replaced the black vent plastic.12 Made sure the exit vent on the back was not crimped or clogged. Checked the little flap door where the vent goes outside to make sure it opens and closes super easy to no air flow is restricted.13. For testing I left the bottom panel open. Make sure you closed the door, reconnect the plug and turn the gas valve back on. Hit the go button on autodry or timed dry. The door must be closed to create the closed circulation of the system so the fan sucks the flame into the tube otherwise the flame will not fire deep  into the tube and will set off one fo the overheat sensors. After hitting the go button your drum will start to rotate, then a few seconds later you'll hear a click and your igniter will start to burn bright orange. Another click and the gas should flow and ignite. 14. This shows that you've fixed the ignition problem. I just replaced everything I thought that could be wrong in stead of hunting and trial and error. All the parts were about $137 so I thought it was worth making sure. 15. IMPORTANT: If during your test the flame turns off after a little while then turns back on only to turn off again, don't panic. This happened to me as well. I found that you need to run the dryer with wet clothes in the dryer. The wetness in the clothes will keep the autodry sensor from shutting off the dryer since there will be moisture in the exhaust. If it's on timed dry the wet clothes will cool the exhaust air and keep the overheat sensors from turning the heat off. So no heating of dry clothes to get out wrinkles. Just dry the wet clothes. This is all I did and it's been working great so far. Good Luck!"

The evaporator fan motor can squeal as its bearing dries out. The motor bearings can totally seize, preventing any movement. The motor coil can also burn out, preventing any fan movement. If this motor fails, the refrigerator compartment will warm up and eventually the freezer will reduce cooling as well. Excessive frost can build up on the evaporator coil due to lack of air movement. The motor can make a squealing noise when it is beginning to fail or will not operate at all when powered, and this is a sign it should be replaced. The evaporator is located in the rear of the freezer compartment. This part measures 2-1/2 inches wide by 3 inches tall by 1 inch thick, at its widest point. It is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/silver. This kit includes the evaporator fan motor and harness.",

I first changed out the defrost thermostat and this did not correct the problem. I done a quick resistance check on the temp sensor that's mounted on the evaporator itself. The resistance would change when holding an ice cube on the sensor so I just assumed it was ok. PLEASE TAKE NOTE: When performing a resistance check on this sensor, make sure your readings match the Samsung temp/resistance chart in their literature. My sensor was way off calibration and was causing the freeze up. Its working as designed now and DW is happy again. Learn from my mistake."

If you notice that your doors open and the mullion either moves freely or is stuck, this hinge needs to be replaced immediately to prevent issues with frost buildup, energy efficiency and temperature fluctuations. Replacing this hinge is quite simple, and you will only need a flathead and Philips-head screwdriver to do it. First, remove the screw covers from the securing screws for the mullion. Unscrew and remove the securing screws with your Philips-head screwdriver, and then pull the mullion up and out carefully to dislodge it from the fridge door. Near the middle of the mullion, disconnect the wire harness to remove the mullion completely. Remove the hinge cover with a flathead screwdriver to expose the hinge, and then carefully remove and replace the old hinge onto its attaching spring. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the door assembly, along with the hinge cover and wire harness.",

This sensor is designed to detect if water begins leaking from the water supply. If/when it detects a leak, it stops the water being supplied to the dishwasher, preventing damage and mess to the dishwasher and home of the user. This sensor may fail when it is exposed to water, so it is important to check this sensor occasionally to ensure it still works. This is an OEM leak sensor, and attaches via its wire harness underneath the dishwasher, so tools like a screwdriver will be necessary. This sensor comes individually and does not come with any other parts or securing screws.",

There was power / voltage there. I jumped out / bypassed the defrost thermostat turned the power back on and the heating elements came on. The problem was the defrost thermostat. So I replaced it with a new one from PartSelect.com. How it works...When the defrost timer is advanced to the defrost cycle the switch closes sending power to the defrost thermostat. If the temperature is low enough, the defrost thermostat switch will close and sends power to the heating elements. When the temperature rises high enough about 55 degrees the switch at the thermostat will open and the heating elements will turn off (not allowing the freezer temperature to get too high, just enough to defrost the coil). The refrigerator will turn back on when the timer advances. The defrost timer will defrost every 8-12 hours."

        "content": "I took a look at the web site where I purchased the parts, then I took a look at the paper enclosed with the order.  Thankfully, I have a battery operated screw driver since there are so many screws.  There are plenty of screws in my refrigerator and freezer doors.  I thought that since my old door gaskets were all chewed up looking, if I changed them, the 10 year old air conditioners and the old fashioned light bulbs to instant on energy saver light bulbs, the electric bill would become more manageable.  The refrigerator and freezer door gaskets were the first step.  They were easy to swap out.  You just need to empty the door of all food items, then pull back the old gasket to see the screws.  There are alot of them.  You should leave 2 loosened screws on each side of the refrigerator door to hold the panel in place while you work and remove the rest.  Then you can remove the old gasket and slide the new one into place.  Make sure as you tighten the screws and replace the ones you removed, the new gasket fits into the door panel groove securely and is in place as you tighen the screws.  Make sure it is in place all the way around the door as you work.  You repeat the procedure for the freezer using only one loosened screw on each side to keep the interior panel in place while you work. It takes some time due to the number of screws, but the work is pretty easy.  I never even broke a nail.  The end caps for the shelf bars just snap into place just as the old ones can be snapped out with a bit of pressure.  They do not have to be wrestled and you need to work carefully so that you do not break them.  (I ordered an extra just in case, but I didn't need it.  I will have it in case I need it in the future)My electric bill dropped from $450 to $110 a month with all the improvements I made.  Thank you Part Select for taking the fear of screwing it up, out of the repair process and making it manageable.  I can afford my electric bill now.  Thanks for your help."

This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually.

Over time, wear and tear may cause tears, gaps, or cuts in the gasket, leading to leaks. This genuine OEM replacement kit is compatible with select models of Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Inglis, and Magic Chef dishwashers.

That repair was also quite easy.PartSelect's full part brochures by model made identifying the needed parts simple, and the replacement a breeze.I even repaired my refrigerator ice maker a couple months ago after purchasing a new control module, and saving both a service fee and the probable full price for a new ice maker.I've repaired my electric clothes dryer too, and hadn't even thought about all the repairs I'd done thanks to this website, until I told the story of my dishwasher.I've probably saved $1000 already.

This coupling features a plastic end with a mainly metal construction and a threaded section near that plastic end to screw into the faucet, whereas the other end connects to an intake hose that feeds into the dishwasher. This faucet adapter coupling is sold as an individual OEM part without any other hoses or connectors but does come with smaller components inside, such as O-rings and a spout adapter. If you notice water leaking from the connector area of this adapter on your dishwasher, it is likely that the adapter has some form of O-ring deterioration, thread wear, or mineral buildup and needs to be replaced. To replace this adapter, make sure your dishwasher and sink are off, and then simply thread this adapter onto the end of your faucet and connect the non-threaded end into the hose.",

When energized, the water inlet valve releases water from the supply line into the ice mold. The water inlet valve is in the back of your refrigerator so you will need to pull the fridge out from the wall before completing this repair. To complete this job, you will need a 1/2 inch wrench, a 1/4 inch nut driver and a utility knife. If your old inlet valve has a screw-in fitting, you may need to simply cut the end of the hose to fit in the new part.

Long story short, during out kitchen remodel I stored the fridge in our unheated Wisconsin garage.  The leftover water in the tank froze, expanded and ruptured it.  Got the replacement, super easy to fix.  The tubing connections are shark bite, just press them together and they're water tight.  Pretty simple plug and play operation but you do have to pull the fridge all the way from the wall and shut off the water supply.I replaced the filter too, just incase the freezing water messed with it in some undetectable way."

        "content": "We opened our freezer last week only to find the bottom 2/3 was barely cold, while only the rear of the upper shelf was cold.  In fact, it was covered in frost, despite being a frost-free model. Our frozen veggies were slushy, not rock hard, and our frozen juices were all liquid.  We defrosted the freezer, plugged it back in, but immediately noticed that we didn't hear the 'whhoooooosh' that you typically hear when you close the freezer door.  After 30 minutes, the rear upper shelf was frosty again, but the rest was still at room temp. We figured the freezer was a goner, so we started looking at new freezers.  I headed online to see if I could fix it, and I eventually found this site.  I had learned online that these symptoms can be caused by either a bad capacitor, or a bad controller (which the capacitor plugs in to).  I guess you can't necessarily tell which of the two parts is defective, so I chose to order/replace both of them.  I ordered the correct parts from partselect.com, and they alerted me that Frigidaire has a new replacement part for the capacitor.  When the parts arrived (quickly, ftw!), I unplugged the freezer and snipped the two wires leading to the controller.  Next I unplugged the controller from the compressor housing.  I spliced the replacement controller's wires into the freezer's wires (using my own wire nuts...as none were included with my order  :(     ).  I snapped the new controller onto the compressor mounting, and then plugged the capacitor in.  I plugged the freezer back in, and it was time for the moment of truth.   The interior light of the freezer came on, and I could hear the compressor 'humming'.   I could hear it humming before the repair, so the big test was to see if it got cold.  I was nervous because the freezer DIDN'T make the 'whoooshing' noise right away, but after just an hour, the 'test' mug of water was already turning into ice.  It was fixed!!!!  If you have these symptoms, you CAN do this!!!  Unplug the freezer.  Cut two wires.  Unplug the controller.  Splice two wires.  Plug in the new controller.  Snap in the new capacitor.  DONE!!!"

This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.",

That took over an hour (not counting the time the dishwasher spent running). Then we tried your diagnosis center and it pointed to the flood switch or the water valve. I extracted the flood switch (another 30-60 minutes) to check it, and it also contained gunk and (significantly) did not rattle, which made me suspect the flood switch was the problem, so I ordered one. Once the replacement arrived, I checked it and the flood switch rattled, confirming that it should work properly. I spent 30-45 minutes installing it, plus the filter assembly and racks I had to remove to access it. Ran the dishwasher and everything came out sparkling clean. I don't know where the gunk came from, but if you aren't getting water and the filter is full of gunk, check the flood switch."

It was exactly what I needed and the fix went quickly with no issues.I ordered two of PS8728568 (Mounting Bracket), because on your site for that part it identifies that each bracket is sold individually. (Reference: “Part Description” section).  In addition, on that same web page under the “Question and Answers” section it identifies that each bracket is sold individually. However, what I received was, two packages with each package having two brackets in it.  It’s understandable, since you need two brackets for each dishwasher.Obviously, this is completely contrary to what your web page states.  In reality, each package is sold with a pair of brackets.I have not opened the second package and as such it is completely resaleable.  As per your Return Policy , I’d like to request a refund for the second packet of brackets and have you cover the return shipping of that package.  Please advise next steps."

I read the installation hints on your web site and want to add the following suggestion.The notes on your web site say you can remove the valve from behind the toe face and pull it out to reach the hose and plug. I found that the Bosch designers called for both the hose and wire to on the short side. I found that pulling the dishwasher forward 6\" to 9\" allows you to access these connections from the side at least to hold them while making the connection. I hope this helps. Thank you, Bill"

The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.",

The assembly regulates the airflow between the freezer and refrigerator compartments. When the refrigerator needs to cool down, the damper receives signals from the thermostat or control board to open and allows more cold air from the freezer to enter the refrigerator compartment. When the desired temperature is reached, the damper closes to restrict airflow. If the damper assembly is faulty or damaged, your fridge will be unable to maintain the desired temperature levels. It may be either too warm leading to food spoilage or too cold leading to frost buildup.",

Replaced the control unit and damper worked and now my fridge is the right temperature! One other item -- when diagnosing the problem with a warm fridge, most newer fridges have a self testing method via the digital temperature controls. Find your Service Data Sheet for instructions. This would have saved me time from using my multimeter testing various components."

I locked onto the switch actuator, the part that the refrigerator door pushes in, with the vise grips and pulled on it just hard enough to get the screw driver inserted in the right side to push in the catch clip so the switch could be pulled out further each time the catch clip was depressed to the next detent. Then I used the screw driver on the left site to encourage the switch past the detents on the left and very quickly the switch was out of the mount. The wires from the refrigerator pulled out with the old switch. I unplugged the old switch from the wires and plugged in the new switch and shoved the new switch back into the mount, wiggled it a couple of times to make sure it was secure and the job was done. Once I applied the vise gripes at first, the whole job took less than a minute."

It is made with some added structural rigidity that makes it stronger and more durable than the original. This model measures 24 1/2 inches long x 19 inches wide x 2 5/8 inches deep.",

        "content": "Removing the old rack was accomplished by removing the grey retainer clips located at the end of the silver rack guides. This allows the entire upper rack to slide out of the guide tracks. Unless you purchased all of the additional parts associated with the rack you must remove the needed old parts such as the spray arm, plate guides, wheel assemblies, etc. to complete the replacement and reassembly. Each of these pieces are \"snapped on\" by clips that are removed with moderate difficulty. Mostly due to the apprehension that you are going to break them, however, with only the pressure exerted by your fingers they will snap off and will go actually go back on easier. The order you remove and replace the various parts is your choice. The exact positioning of the parts back on the new rack is critical, so if your memory is not good, take a quick photo with your cell phone for reference. The only tool I used was a small screwdriver to separate the clip when I first removed the rack, but in retrospect I could have removed it by hand. The key thing to remember is do not apply excess force when trying to remove the old parts, just direct  pressure with your fingers. Good luck, it took me only about 15 minutes from start to finish. The best part is I probably saved $150.00 by doing it myself, figuring service time for a repairman, plus his mark-up on the parts."

The screw are located on the inside edge of the door, there are 10-12 of them. Spearated the door shells carefully, trying not to disturb the location of the wiring in the middle of the door. Found the 4 screws that hold the module assembly to the door from the inside, and removed them. Popped the assembly out, cleaned the gasket-seat area and placed the new one in place. Carefully tightened the 4 screws. It is easy to over-tighten them, so only turn them until you feel they are snug. Let the gasket do the work. Attached the two solenoid control wires in the same positions they were in before they were removed from the old assembly. Re-assembled the door halves, again taking care to not over-tighten the phillips-head screws. One got \"spun\" and I removed it and re-set it into some epoxy. Returned power to the dishwasher, and stopped washing dishes by hand. Note: the latch is now made with a plastic that is more dense, and likely will not fail as soon as the original one did. I think GE learned something about the durability of their component plastics since this was originally built."

The drain pan is made out of thin sheet metal with a galvanized coating that will not hold up it will start rusting in a short time. I inspected the drain pan cleaned it up with a little Muretic acid and it had too many rust holes so I couldn't repair it. I ordered a new Drain pan on Part Select and when it came in I washed it and dried it completely then I sprayed it with Cold Galvanizing compound with zinc particles. You can get this from Home Depot on the spray paint isle. Hopefully the spray Galvanizing will keep it from rusting in the future and leaking inside the refrigerator. The Trough Drain Pan should have been made of Stainless sheet metal or plastic I don't really know why they used the galvanized coated pan. Everything went back together in reverse with no problems. Hopefully this drain pan will last longer than the first drain pan because it was only 4 years old. I remember when the older refrigerators would run for decades."
