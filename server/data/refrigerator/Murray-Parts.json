You will need a hammer and punch to complete this repair, which most of our customers rated as easy. Make sure you tap the new bearing into place evenly inside the tire rim.",

It is made of steel and is approximately 1.5 inches long. The clip acts as a fastener to prevent the moving parts from loosening and falling off during usage. The clip is vulnerable to corrosion and general wear over time. However, it can also fail prematurely due to overloading and excessive stress. A damaged hairpin clip will result in misalignment of parts, accidental disassembly, increased friction and wear, and potential harm to the user. Remove the faulty pin and align the new one with the insertion points. Ensure that the pin is securely fitted in its appropriate slot and compress the ends to prevent it from dislodging.",
