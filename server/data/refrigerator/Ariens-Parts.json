You might notice that the shaft of your machine is rotating normally but the augers are not moving with it. It is important to address a damaged shear bolt promptly to avoid costly repairs or equipment failure. To remove the shear bolt from your machine, use a wrench or socket to turn it counterclockwise. As this replacement part is sold individually, it is strongly recommended that you keep spare bolts on hand in the event that they break.",
