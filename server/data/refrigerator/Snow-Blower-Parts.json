This hold down clip is used to secure the chute of various models of snowblowers, and is sold as an individual OEM part, without any securing hardware. Made of nylon, this clip secures to the chute with two screws and two washers. If you notice a wobbly or insecure chute resulting in excessive vibrations from the chute, check to make sure the clip is in-place before inspecting it for damage and ordering a replacement. To replace this clip, you will need to gain access to the chute, with either a screwdriver or wrench, and once you can access it, it is as simple as unscrewing the old clip and installing the new clip and rest of the assembly.",

Specifically, it allows the augers of your machine to stop while the shaft and gear case continue to rotate. To check if the shear bolt is broken, inspect it for fractures or missing pieces. You might notice that the shaft of your machine is rotating normally but the augers are not moving with it. It is important to address a damaged shear bolt promptly to avoid costly repairs or equipment failure. To remove the shear bolt from your machine, use a wrench or socket to turn it counterclockwise. As this replacement part is sold individually, it is strongly recommended that you keep spare bolts on hand in the event that they break.",

      "description": "This individually sold shear pin is an OEM replacement that is most typically used in snowblowers but can also be used within snowblower attachments for lawn tractors. Its main uses are connecting the auger and auger shaft, which are the rotating blades, and to protect more valuable components such as the transmission.If the snow is causing excessive force or there is a jam within the auger and connected housing,it will cause the shear pin to snap, effectively stopping the rotation of the auger, while the auger shaft and gears will continue turning. If the shear pin snaps, snow will simply build up on the outside of the auger housing, since the auger will no longer spin. This shear pin has a .25-inch diameter, and 1.5-inch length and is sold individually. Most augers have a pin on each side, so you may need to purchase more than one, and it is also recommended that you carry spare pins in case of a future breakage.",

      "description": "This shear bolt and nut, also known as the shear bolt assembly, is sourced from the original manufacturer, and it is guaranteed to fit your snowblower. Each assembly includes one metal shear bolt and one metal nut, located at the connection point between the auger and gearbox/shaft. It is a safety mechanism designed to protect the snowblower auger from damage caused by sudden stops or excessive resistance. When the auger encounters a blockage or excessive load the shear bolt will break thereby preventing more severe damage to the gearbox. Once the bolt is sheared, it will need to be replaced. The bolt will also need to be replaced if it is bent or worn down, as a faulty shear bolt can result in damage to the auger, gearbox, and motor, as well as reduced equipment ability to throw snow, and increased safety risks. Use a socket or wrench to unthread the nut and remove the broken shear bolt. Align the new shear bolt with the mounting hole and secure it with the new nut. Note that this is a common repair and it is best to have several spare shear bolts and nuts on hand.",
