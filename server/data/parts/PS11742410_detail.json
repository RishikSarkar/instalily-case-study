  "description": "Refrigerator Freezer Door Key ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 3 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11742410 Manufacturer Part Number WP4356840 This metal freezer door key has a cross shape and is approximately 2 inches long. If your freezer door will not stay shut, you can use the key as a quick fix to keep it closed. If your key will not lock, or unlock the freezer door, check to see if it has been bent or damaged. If the key is damaged, you should look to replace it to avoid damaging the lock. The key should engage the locking mechanism with ease. If the lock sticks when you turn the key, penetrating fluid should be used to loosen the mechanism. These keys are sold separately, and should be stored somewhere safe and not next to the unit.",

No return label has been sent and its 6 days later. You're delay is forcing us outside of  the 30 day return period.  I hope you keep your word and give me my money back."
