    "title": "Ice box and freezer would not get cold,the back wall of the freezer was covered with ice",
    "content": "1. I had to defrost the ice off of the back wall of the freezer with a blowdryer.2. Removed the four 1/4'' screws and removed the back panel.3. Defrosted all of the ice off the coils and heater.4. I replaced the defrost thermostat and heater by following the directions that came with them. The directions are very clear and easy to follow. I had a single element heater, and the replacement was a double element, the directions even explained how to rearrange the wires to make it work. The whole job only really consisted of cutting two wires that are color coded on the thermostat and resplicing the new ones in. I used scotch locks and electrical tape for the splices. The element had connectors on it so I just removed two screws, unplugged two wires and plugged them on the new one.The greatest thing about this repair was that I troubleshot the problem using the PartSelect website, ordered the parts and they arrived at my house in less than 24 hours.Thank You."
