    "title": "No power to the fan and compressor",
    "content": "I have a fridge in my garage.  I have found that a glass of ice water or a cold drink outside is very important to me.   When I discovered melting ice dripping onto the garage floor I was very upset.  I spun the fridge and found that the compressor and fan weren't starting.  I got out my multi-meter and discovered that power was not making it to these components.  I did some research and found the wiring diagram online.  There really isn't too much going on with a fridge and the most likely candidate seemed to be the run capacitor.  I ordered the part, replaced it in a few minutes and the fridge began working again."
