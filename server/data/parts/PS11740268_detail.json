    "title": "Ice wouldn't dispense from the door.",
    "content": "Simple.  Removed the outer ice/water dispenser cover with two screws on the bottom, then removed the ice door mechanism and replaced the small sealing door and door motor.  Reassembled and tested .  Works perfect.  Replacing the door was neccessary as the foam gasket was worn and probably leaking air even though the motor was the real problem.  I would absolutely recommend changing the door anytime you have to replace any other part. PartSelect is amazing...ordered the parts on Friday, had them in-hand on  Sunday...all for less than $3.00 shipping.  Will do business with again."
