  "description": "Kelvinator Refrigerator Ice Maker Assembly ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 84 Reviews PartSelect Number PS12364147 Manufacturer Part Number 241798231 This 8-cube ice maker is used to create ice for your refrigerator. The ice maker receives water from the water inlet valve and will freeze until ice cubes are formed. Once the water has been frozen the cubes will be ejected from the mold in to the ice bucket. The ice maker will continue the process until the ice bucket has reached the limit. If your ice maker is not making ice you may need to replace this part. Please remember to disconnect the power and water supply before starting your repair. This ice maker is a genuine OEM part.",
