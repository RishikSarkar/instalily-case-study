  "description": "Samsung Dishwasher Door Guide Cap PartSelect Number PS12721288 Manufacturer Part Number DD67-00113B This dishwasher door cap guide is a genuine OEM replacement designed for Samsung WaterWall dishwashers. The door cap guide serves an aesthetic purpose by hiding mounting screws or other hardware on the dishwasher cabinet. It also protects the hardware from moisture, debris, or hard impacts. It is normal for the cap to become damaged or worn down over time due to normal mechanical stress, aging, or accidents. Over time the cap may crack or break, the adhesive backing may wear down or the cover may be unable to stay securely in place. You will need to replace the door cap or the mounting hardware on the exterior panel will be exposed. Simply pull off the faulty cap and snap the new one into place.",
