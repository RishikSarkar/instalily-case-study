  "description": "Inglis Dishwasher Upper Spray Arm Mount ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 61 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11746245 Manufacturer Part Number WP8539324 This upper spray arm mount has been redesigned by the manufacturer, so it not longer requires a clip and screw to be installed. To replace this part, first remove the rack stops from the upper dish rack and pull out the dish rack to work on it. Remove the screw holding the spray arm in place, take off the spray arm and slide out the feeding tube. Flip the rack over to remove the mounting bracket from the mount. Snap the new mount into place and replace the other parts.",
