    "title": "A prong in the bottom rack had broken nearly through where it attached to the base & was rusting severely. Several other prongs had also started to rust.",
    "content": "The bottom rack of our Bosch dishwasher was discontinued & no longer available anywhere, so we ordered an OEM replacement rack from PartSelect.com & hoped that it would fit. The new rack fits perfectly & is actually an improvement over the old one.  The new rack doesn't have a vase tower, but that is actually a big design improvement because it can store more dishes & is more flexible than the old one. The new rack comes without a handle cover, but it was very easy to move the handle cover from our old rack to the new one."
