  "description": "LG Dishwasher ROLLER ASSEMBLY ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 1 Review PartSelect Number PS12075858 Manufacturer Part Number 4581DD3003C The dishwasher roller assembly connects to the dishrack, and is located in the lower level of the dishwasher. It allows the dishrack to easily slide in and out. If the lower rack keeps falling off the track in your dishwasher, makes noises, the door will not close, or the dishes are not getting clean, then it is best to replace it for more security. A flat blade screw driver is the only tool needed for this installation. Open the lower dishwasher rack and remove retaining tabs from both ends of the rack and slide it out. Locate the older roll assembly, remove it and replace the rollers. Remember to put the tabs on each side back before sliding it back in. Make sure the dishwasher is off before starting this installation project.",
