  "description": "Dishwasher Middle Spray Arm Kit ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 129 Reviews PartSelect Number PS382824 Manufacturer Part Number 675808 This middle spray arm kit includes an upper spray arm, a holder or hanger, water supply tube or delivery tube, split ring seal, and a screw. The function of these parts is to spray water to all levels of the dishwasher so the dishes will come out completely clean. This kit has recently been redesigned. It does not include the upper support or mount, so consider ordering those parts as well if necessary. The spray arm is approximately 18 inches long, and all parts are white in colour. The only tool you will need to complete this repair is a Phillips screw driver.",

    "title": "Lower spray arm was not turing properly and causing poor wash results",
    "content": "I noticed the upper bushing washer was worn thin.  this caused the lower spray arm to rise too high and wobble during all the wash cycles. Also the rotation of the lower spray arm was wearing grooves in the lower bushing.  I removed the retaining nut and simply replaced teh defective parts.  While I was at it I figured equal wear might be evident on the upper spray arm so I bought a complete rebuild kit to bring all rotational parts back to new and equal preformance  that was achieved by removing the ss screw and removing the upper spray arm, bushing and clip then replacing them in the order of removal.  Noticed a huge difference in the quality of the washed dishes!!  Thanks Parts Select 100% to yoru company!!"
