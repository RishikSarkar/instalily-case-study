  "description": "Tappan Refrigerator Door Handle ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 42 Reviews PartSelect Number PS427922 Manufacturer Part Number 218428101 This white handle can be used with both the freezer door and the fresh food door of many refrigerators. Note: As per the manufacturer, this handle includes the mounting block and screw for the top of the handle. If you need the screw for the bottom, it must be ordered separately. This is a simple repair that only requires a Phillips screwdriver. You will remove the 2 screws located on the top of the fridge door and slide the old handle out of place. Take your new handle and use your screwdriver to position back into place.",
