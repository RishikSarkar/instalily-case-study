  "description": "Dishwasher Detergent Dispenser with Rinse Cap ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 26 Reviews PartSelect Number PS958966 Manufacturer Part Number WD12X10163 This detergent dispenser assembly is attached to the inner door panel of a dishwasher. This part holds detergent and dishwasher rinse products in a covered container. If your dispenser will not open, close, dispense detergent properly, or the dishes are coming out of the dishwasher dirty, replacing this part can solve these problems. The tools needed for this installation project are a #2 Phillips screwdriver and needle-nose pliers. To repair, first remove screws from the bottom of the inner door panel. Next, remove connecters, wires, and screws from the dispenser to access it and replace with new dispenser. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions and guidance. Unplug dishwasher from power source as a safety precaution.",

    "content": "Turned off power to unit, 'cuz it has a solenoid lead to open the soap door. Removed the phillips head screws that held the door together. The screw are located on the inside edge of the door, there are 10-12 of them. Spearated the door shells carefully, trying not to disturb the location of the wiring in the middle of the door. Found the 4 screws that hold the module assembly to the door from the inside, and removed them. Popped the assembly out, cleaned the gasket-seat area and placed the new one in place. Carefully tightened the 4 screws. It is easy to over-tighten them, so only turn them until you feel they are snug. Let the gasket do the work. Attached the two solenoid control wires in the same positions they were in before they were removed from the old assembly. Re-assembled the door halves, again taking care to not over-tighten the phillips-head screws. One got \"spun\" and I removed it and re-set it into some epoxy. Returned power to the dishwasher, and stopped washing dishes by hand. Note: the latch is now made with a plastic that is more dense, and likely will not fail as soon as the original one did. I think GE learned something about the durability of their component plastics since this was originally built."
