    "content": "I got lucky and found the diagnostic test instructions tucked inside the washer under the kick plate. From there I ran the tests on each component until I narrowed it down to the pump.  The pump cost me less than local dealers. The install went well. Watched the online videos to make sure I was doing it right. Was actually very easy and saved hundreds over a service call."
