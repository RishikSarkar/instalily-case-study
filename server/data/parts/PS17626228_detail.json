  "description": "Dishwasher TIMER ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 7 Reviews PartSelect Number PS17626228 Manufacturer Part Number WD21X33641 This is a timer for use in dishwashers. The timer is responsible for ensuring the various parts of the dishwasher cycle activate at the correct time. If the timer is in any way broken or faulty, it will cause your dishwasher to not start, take longer than normal or finish too early, and will need to be replaced as soon as possible. This timer features a mostly metal construction and features a wire terminal on its top side. Replacing this timer will require a few tools, like a screwdriver or socket wrench, and some disassembly of your dishwasher will be necessary. This timer is an individual OEM part, so it does not come with any accessories.",
