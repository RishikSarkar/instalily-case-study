    "content": "Remove screws from lower hinge and carefully remove the door. In my case it was the lower bearing, flip door upside down being careful to remove anything which might fall off first. I removed  the door stop and then pulled the broken bearing out with pliers. Then I pushed the new one in and reassembled it."
