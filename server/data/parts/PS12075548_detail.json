    "title": "This Ice maker tray flexes to release the cubes, and the rectangular slot in the tray splits apart  not allowing the tray to flex and release the cubes. - its a weak design.",
    "content": "I reinforced the ice cube tray rectangular slot with a thin .080\" plastic disc cut to fit the ice tray - you need to remove the cube tray from the round holder, add the reinforcement around the plastic slot then reinstall.  Also, I polished the cube trays with Carnuba wax (food safe) to better release the ice. All is well now, and I have 2 spare ice trays modified and ready to install. This is a tray design issue - Bosch should increase thickness of  the molded plastic fitment and tray where the ice tray engages the motor."
