    "content": "Checked the water line from the wall to the supply port of the inlet valve and it was suppling water but no water beyond the water inlet valve, So I ordered a new inlet valve and installed, and it fixed the problem.  Inlet valve supplies water to the ice maker and water dispenser filter housing. Partselect videos and you tube installation videos very helpful.  Partselect troubleshooting guide also very helpful.  Great company"
