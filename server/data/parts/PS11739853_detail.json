    "content": "Replaced the ice bin button by removing the ice bin, turning it upside down and dumping the ice, and replacing the pastic part that broke with the right size socket.  It was very easy.  Part was easy to find at PartSelect.  Would have just left it broken if I could not find the part as a repair person would have charged $100 just to come to the house and I would have had to take off work.  With PartSelect, it cost me $15 and I fixed it myself in under 10 minutes.  Way to go PartSelect!!"
