    "title": "The original plastic and rope in the closing mechanism broke and needed replacing.",
    "content": "Note: The diagram and part description misled me to think that each item was a quantity of one, so I ordered two since I wanted to replace the part on each side of the door. In fact, both the cable repair kit and the guide came with a quantity of two, so have an extra set that I will likely never need. As far as the replacement, it was quick and easy. The hardest part was pulling the dishwasher out from under the cabinet."
