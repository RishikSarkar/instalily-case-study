    "title": "Rinse Aid Cap  was not secured and during dishwaher run the cap sat on the heating coil and melted.",
    "content": "This is simple, we don't know exactly how, but when we used the dishwasher the cap must not have been twisted correctly, and after the dishwasher shut down we discovered the cap was on the heating coil and melted. I know that it was easy to fix, but the reason I ordered it from PartsSelect was their price was much lower than Kitchen Aids, (the maker), Lowes (where we bought it), and other sites we searched for the part."
