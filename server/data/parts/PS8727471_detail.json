  "description": "Bosch Dishwasher Adjustable Tine Row Clip ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 2 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8727471 Manufacturer Part Number 00611981 This part is a replacement tine row clip for your dishwasher. The tine row clip is adjustable, and it fits onto your dishrack to holds the tines into place. If your dishrack tine rows will not stay in position, you could have one or more broken tine clips. To replace a tine row clip, simply snap the old tine row clip out, and replace it with the new clip. This part is made of gray plastic and is approximately one inch long and half an inch wide. This part is sold individually, so it is a good idea to check all of your tine row clips to determine if more than one are broken.",

    "content": "Removed two rusted tines lines, then I unclipped the stabilizers, installed four other  positioning clips, put the two adjustable tines in the two vertical plastic stabilizers at the ends of the lower baskets. Worked like a charm and all is good. May I suggest using stainless steel or more nickel in the iron used in the basket or a thicker or more durable plastic in the tines."
