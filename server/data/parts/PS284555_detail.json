    "content": "The only part that I should had used was the condensor fan motor,which it was so easy to remove,and instaled the new one,then replaced the missing parts and problem solved.  The technician before me,declare the unit a total loss,there for after doing that, he took  the rest of the parts with him for his own benefit. The repair was with no difficulty,and time spend around 20 min. Thanks.PartSelect,your delivery and easy way to place an order is great. Thanks. Joel"
