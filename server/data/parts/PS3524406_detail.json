  "description": "LG Dishwasher Hinge Cable ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 27 Reviews PartSelect Number PS3524406 Manufacturer Part Number 4933DD3001B This dishwasher door hinge cable assembly connects the door to the spring. The door hinge cable and the door spring apply tension to the door to prevent it from dropping open too quickly. This part contains two plastic pieces which are approximately 2 inches in length by 3/4-inch in width, as well as a rope portion that measures approximately 8 inches in length. When beginning this repair, be sure to use caution when replacing the door hinge cable. The spring to which the door hinge cable attaches is under tension and could snap. This part is sold individually.",

    "content": "Removed mounting screws from sides of disher. Removed broken piece of connector assy still attached to hinge. Attached new connector assy to hinge then looped it around pulley with spring attached to opposite end. Need both hands to pull spring up to side of tub and connect it.  I would suggest replacing both connector assemblies while you have the dishwasher pulled out. Push dishwasher back in and mount with screws."
