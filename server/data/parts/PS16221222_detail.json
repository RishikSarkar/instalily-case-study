  "description": "Admiral Dishwasher GASKET ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 15 Reviews PartSelect Number PS16221222 Manufacturer Part Number W11498831 This door gasket is a genuine OEM replacement part that is specially designed for your dishwasher. The gasket is located around the frame of the dishwasher. It is a rubber seal that helps prevent water from leaking out of the dishwasher during the wash cycle. It also helps to absorb the noise and vibrations created while the dishwasher is running. Over time the gasket may wear down, tear, or fall off due to exposure to heat and chemicals. If the gasket can no longer create a watertight seal, it is best to replace it promptly to keep your dishwasher running efficiently and to prevent potential accidents.",

    "content": "Removed old gasket. Cleaned the area and let dry. Aligned gasket, pressed into the groove. Corners are tricky, stretch and press to get a tight seal. Follow around appliance. Inital try, small leak. Adjusted seal second use no leak. 10/10 would recommend this part. Super easy self install."
