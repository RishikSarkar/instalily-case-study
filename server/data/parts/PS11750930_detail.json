    "title": "Replaced black front w/ stainless steel",
    "content": "The only appliance that wasn't SS was my $900 dishwasher that was tiled-in when my kitchen floors were done...I can only replace it by removing the granite counter.  I ordered the SS front and handle to update the look of the 4 year old DW and it was a really good idea.  * screws later and it was done.  The 'repair' took 15-20 minutes and the results are amazing.  BTW...the parts took less than 2 business days to arrive..."
