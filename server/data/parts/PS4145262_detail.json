  "description": "Samsung Refrigerator French Door Hinge ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 4 Reviews PartSelect Number PS4145262 Manufacturer Part Number DA61-08305A This French door hinge is an authentic OEM part used in refrigerators. It is used to provide support and stability to the door allowing it to open and close smoothly. The hinge is vulnerable to wear and tear, and mechanical damage over time. A faulty door hinge will result in difficulty opening/closing the door, door misalignment, inadequate sealing, and increased energy consumption. To begin this repair, locate the screws that hold the hinge to the refrigerator frame and remove them. Carefully lift the door off the hinge and set it aside. Remove the faulty hinge and position the new one in its place. Reattach the door to the new hinge and secure the hinge to the refrigerator frame using the appropriate fasteners.",
