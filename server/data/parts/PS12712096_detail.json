  "description": "Hoover Refrigerator ARM-SHUT ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 6 Reviews PartSelect Number PS12712096 Manufacturer Part Number W11342242 This ice level arm, also known as an ice shutoff arm, is designed to detect the level of ice within the ice bin of your ice maker or refrigerator and turn it off when enough ice has been made. When the ice maker is empty, the arm will be down. When the ice maker is full, the arm will be raised, and over time, wear and tear to the level arm can cause the ice maker to stop making ice completely. To replace this arm, unplug your appliance and remove the ice making assembly, then pull the levelling arm out of the assembly and place the new one. Consisting of a long, angled metal arm and a plastic flap, this level arm is a genuine OEM part that is compatible with a wide-range of refrigerators and icemakers and measures at approximately 9-inches by 4.5-inches.",
