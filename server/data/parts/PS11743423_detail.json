    "content": "The unit had power, but the controls would not work.  The \"clean\" light was blinking.  I first replaced the control unit, no help.  I then used the \"just ask\" and was told the problem was the heating element and/or the hi-temp thermostat.  I replaced both those and used the re-set code pushing the \"hi-temp/air dry, hi-temp/air dry\" buttons.  That did it.  Easy parts to locate and replace.  It took longer pulling the unit out and putting it back than it did to replace the parts."
