  "description": "Refrigerator EVAPORATOR FAN BLADE ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 9 Reviews PartSelect Number PS12730613 Manufacturer Part Number WR60X30922 This evaporator fan blade is for your refrigerator, and it circulates air so that the temperature of the fridge is regulated. This model has 3 blades, and is a little more than 4 inches in diameter. It is made of white plastic and is sold individually. If your refrigerator is noisy and you hear a clicking sound, it is a good indication that the evaporator fan blade is warped or damaged. If the fridge or freezer sections become too warm, the fan could be to blame as well.",
