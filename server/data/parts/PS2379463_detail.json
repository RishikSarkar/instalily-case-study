    "content": "replacing dishrack was simply removing old and sliding new onto track. however, removing and reinstalling water dispenser blade mounted on bottom of existing rack to new rack required much more time and effort .I needed to use flat screwdriver to pry plastic clamps apart and then a pair of channel locks to release assembly from original rack. It took some effort to finally accomplish . I believe all models that use this replacement rack would have this same issue with the dispenser blade and instructions for re-installation should accompany the new rack or better yet, new blade should be included on rack for those not familiar with using tools."
