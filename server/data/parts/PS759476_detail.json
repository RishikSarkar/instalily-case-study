  "description": "Refrigerator Power Cord ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 3 Reviews PartSelect Number PS759476 Manufacturer Part Number WR23X10300 This heavy-duty cord has a three-pronged plug (2 electrical, 1 grounding). The power cord supplies power to your refrigerator, allowing it to keep the contents inside cool. There could be an issue with your cord if you notice that the refrigerator will not turn on, or intermittently turns on and off. Check the cord for fraying, or other visible damage. If the power cord shows any signs of damage, replace the cord immediately as it could become an electrical or fire hazard. Before you begin this repair, ensure that the power is disconnected from the unit, and that all food that could ruin is stored away while the power is off.",
