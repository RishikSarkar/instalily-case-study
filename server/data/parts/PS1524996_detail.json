    "content": "First thing I did was turn off the power to the dishwasher, then remove the racks.  Remove the foot plates, remove the two top screws holding the dishwasher.  Then using the socket  set, retract the two foot stands to pull the dishwasher forward.  You may not have to do this step as I had to get it over tile.  The pully springs are on the sides, easily replaced.  After replacing the springs and I recommend replacing both at the same time, put everything back.  The hardest part will be the foot plates, there are two and getting them lined up and the screws back in is a bit of a challenge.  Then you are done."
