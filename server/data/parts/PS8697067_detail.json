  "description": "Gaggenau Dishwasher Lower Rack Wheel with Clip ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 10 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8697067 Manufacturer Part Number 00165314 This dishrack wheel is designed for use on the lower rack of your dishwasher, it allows the rack to roll in and out of your appliance with ease. This roller wheel includes the locking clip required for installation. The roller wheel attaches directly to the rack, you simply snap it into place on the frame of the rack, it does not include the axel. Due to how the roller wheels wear out we recommend replacing them in pairs. The diameter of the wheel is approximately one and a half inches. The roller wheel and clip are made of plastic.",
