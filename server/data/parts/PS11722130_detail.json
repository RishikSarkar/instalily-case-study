  "description": "Refrigerator Water Filter ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 96 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11722130 Manufacturer Part Number EDR4RXD1 This water filter (Whirlpool EveryDrop Refrigerator Water Filter, Single Turn Filter) purifies water going to the water dispenser and sometimes the icemaker as well. This part should be replaced if it is causing reduced water flow or just replaced periodically per the owner manual. Replacing this water filter may fix a noisy or leaking fridge, a fridge that is not dispensing water (or reduced flow rate), and an ice maker that is not making ice at all, or not making enough ice. This filter is white, sold individually and measures 8 inches by 3 inches in diameter. This water filter has been updated by the manufacturer. It may appear different but will still function the same. It is sold individually.",
