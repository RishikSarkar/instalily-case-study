    "title": "Water Not Draining.",
    "content": "There are videos on YouTube that demonstrate the repair process better than I can type. I will say I'm not certain why the dishwasher wasn't draining other than when I removed the chamber collection and repositioned the ball filter it would work as it should until the next time. Replacing the sump, chamber collection, and ball filter was a shot in the dark. The tub insulation was an improvement on noise. The first cycle seemed to be draining water better. Overall the removal and installation of the parts was not difficult."
