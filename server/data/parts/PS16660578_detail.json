    "title": "Upper coupling broken on Ice Bucket Assembly and inner segment and shroud broken on Chute Assembly.",
    "content": "I was disappointed you have to purchase the entire Ice Bucket Assembly in order to get the upper coupling. I also ordered the two seals and washer, only to find they are included in the Chute Assembly. The Chute was a little difficult to remove and reinstall. Other than that the Ice Bucket slides right in and the Chute Assembly requires 2 Phillips screws and 2 hex screws to be removed and reinstalled."
