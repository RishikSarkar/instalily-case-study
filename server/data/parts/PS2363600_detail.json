  "description": "Kelvinator Refrigerator Crisper Drawer Cover ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 32 Reviews PartSelect Number PS2363600 Manufacturer Part Number 240364787 This is a cover for the crisper pan in your refrigerator. This cover is designed to allow both crisper drawers to slide in and remain covered, while also offering shelf storage above. This cover is made of durable white plastic that measures 25.75 inches wide and 18.75 inches deep and features two sliders on each side to adjust the humidity as necessary. This cover is only the frame for the crisper drawer assembly and does not come with the necessary glass pane insert. If your current crisper drawer cover is cracked or broken and not able to support the drawers or glass above it, it needs to be replaced. This cover is an OEM part and is sold individually.",
