    "title": "Dishwasher timer not working.",
    "content": "Our older dishwasher would get hung up and not proceed to its next wash cycle. I removed the power to the unit took it apart to inspect. I figured it was somthing to do with the timer. I unhooked the power connection to the motor for the timer. I then plugged the unit back in and checked voltage to the timer motor. I had power at the connection. I then plugged the connection back into the timer motor. The timer motor still did not function. I went online looking for parts and found this site www.partselect.com. All the parts needed to make repairs were listed and good pictures showing the parts I needed. The part was recived a couple days later. I installed the new timer plugged the unit it and it works great now. I even purched a couple other parts to make the unit good as new."
