    "content": "I Looked on internet sites for this type of problem.Most sites said the support rollers could cause this.I found your site PartSelect and with help of your diagrams of the machine ordered the parts I thought were needed plus other parts that might cause the problem. With machine torn down I replaced the rollers.I had also ordered the main drive belt and idler assembly with the rollers and these also needed replacement.  It is a good idea to order other suspect parts when doing this type of repair since you can return the parts not needed.Your return policy is great.Edward Brennan"
