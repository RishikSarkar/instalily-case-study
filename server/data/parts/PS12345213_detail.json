  "description": "Haier Refrigerator FULL WIRE SHELF ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 4 Reviews PartSelect Number PS12345213 Manufacturer Part Number WR71X28172 This white full wire shelf is an authentic OEM replacement part for refrigerators. It has dimensions of 10 inches by 15 inches and it is placed along the entire width of the refrigerator compartment. The shelf provides a stable and durable surface for storing food items and its placement can be adjusted according to your needs. Over time the shelf can break, bend, or become warped, due to age or excessive weight. It is important not to overload your shelf as this can lead to premature failure. Replacing the shelf is a simple repair that does not require specialized tools. To remove the old shelf, simply lift it upward to disengage it from the support brackets and pull it out of the refrigerator. Position the new wire shelf on the brackets and ensure it is well aligned.",
