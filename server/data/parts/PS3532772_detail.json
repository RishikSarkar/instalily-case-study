  "description": "LG Refrigerator Roller Assembly ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 11 Reviews PartSelect Number PS3532772 Manufacturer Part Number AHJ72909001 This is a drawer roller for the freezer compartment of your LG refrigerator. This roller is made of white plastic, and acts as a wheel to allow the drawer to glide smoothly back and forth when you open and close the freezer compartment. Over time and with further frequent use, this roller can crack, break, or stop rolling smoothly, at which point it will need replacing. Your refrigerator comes with two rollers, and this roller is sold individually, so consider how many rollers you require before ordering.",
