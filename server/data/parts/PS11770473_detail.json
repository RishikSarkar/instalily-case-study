  "description": "Uni Refrigerator Handle set (2 pieces) - White ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 124 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11770473 Manufacturer Part Number 5304506469 This Refrigerator Handle set comes in 2 pieces, and measures roughly 17\" in length. It can be installed with a screwdriver to allow the door to be opened and closed. If your handle is visibly broken then it should be replaced. Refer to your model number, and user manual to see if this part is right for you. These door handles are not sold individually, so we recommend replacing both handles at one time, or keeping the second one as a spare in case of future repairs. If you require the mounting blocks for the handle, these are sold separately. To make the repair, simply remove the screws at the top of the lower door, and replace the handle, screwing it into place.",
