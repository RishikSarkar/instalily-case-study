    "content": "I took out the plate that covers the evaporator in the freezer with 3/8 nut driver. I removed the clips holding on the fan cover and used the pliers to take the fan off the old motor. I then took the old motor out, affixed the fan to the new motor and replaced the motor and fan assembly.  I reassembled the entire fan assembly and reinstalled the evaporator plate"
