  "description": "Refrigerator Water Filter ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 16 Reviews PartSelect Number PS16217433 Manufacturer Part Number XWFE This water filter is found in the rear upper-right corner of the interior of the refrigerator. If your model has a replacement indicator light it will turn red to signal the need for a replacement. If your model does not have an indicator light, the filter cartridge should be replaced every six months or earlier if you notice a decrease in the flow of water from the dispenser. The filter media is carbon black and reduces leads, some pharmaceuticals, and fifty other contaminates. It is 2 inches deep, 6 inches high, 2.25 inches wide and weighs approximately 1 lbs. When it comes time to replace the filter, first discard the old one by turning it to the left to remove. It will release itself when it has been turned far enough. Installation instructions are quick and simple but can vary slightly depending on if it is a bottom-freezer, side-by-side or multi-door bottom-freezer model. Refer to the user instructions for you filter. Do not forget to reset the filter change indicator if applicable. In bottom-freezer and side-by-side models this is done by pressing and holding the RESET WATER FILTER bottom for three seconds. On a multi-door bottom-freezer model, press the button underneath the Confirm Filter Change message while the water is dispensing. On select models this reset is done automatically once a new filter is installed.",
