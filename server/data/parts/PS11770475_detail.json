This door handle set includes two 17-inch-long black handles that slide on and screw into your refrigerator door. If your current refrigerator door handles for your fridge or freezer compartments are missing, damaged, unsightly, or unable to pull the door, they will need replacing. To replace a door handle, unthread the screw securing its top and slide it down to release, then slide the new handle on and secure its top. This set includes two OEM door handles, but does not include their securing screws, which are instead sold separately.",
