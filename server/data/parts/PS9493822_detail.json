    "content": "I ordered a freezer gasket/insulation lining; just pulled the old one out and put in pressed in the new one; solved the problem easily.  Then the refrigerator gasket was falling apart.  I was ready to buy a new refrigerator but then I got laid off from work.  I ordered the 2nd gasket.  It did not fit easily at all.  My husband had to man-handle and stretch it; then it worked, as worked well ever since.  Spent $250 instead of $1250+.  Thanks.   P.S.  Could not find the year of the frig."
