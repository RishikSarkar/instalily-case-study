  "description": "RCA Refrigerator Crisper Drawer Cover ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 83 Reviews PartSelect Number PS890565 Manufacturer Part Number WR32X10398 The crisper drawer cover sits on top of your vegetable crispers and helps to maintain proper crisper temperatures. It also doubles as a sturdy lower shelf for extra storage in your refrigerator. If the drawer cover is damaged or cracked, it will not be able to do either of its jobs, and should be replaced. This replacement cover features shallow, wide grooves to prevent leaks and to catch spills. It also has rail brackets underneath to hold the drawer, allowing the drawer to slide in and out. It is made with some added structural rigidity that makes it stronger and more durable than the original. This model measures 24 1/2 inches long x 19 inches wide x 2 5/8 inches deep.",
