  "description": "Samsung Refrigerator Door Closing Mechanism ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 3 Reviews PartSelect Number PS4176636 Manufacturer Part Number DA97-12625A This Samsung auto-close lever assembly is an OEM replacement part made for use in Samsung refrigerators. It is a black lever mechanism, measuring approximately 2 inches by 2 inches. When the fridge door is opened, this part ensures that the door that the door closes is able to close by itself and remains securely shut. If you notice that your fridge door can’t seem to close properly, or it is unstable and slams shut, then the lever assembly will likely need to be replaced. This part is typically located at the top of the fridge door. Each auto-close lever is sold individually.",
