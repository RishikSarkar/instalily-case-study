  "description": "Dishwasher CONSOLE CVR GRAPHICS Assembly ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 4 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11766992 Manufacturer Part Number WD34X21699 This is the user interface cover, which goes over the user interface panel on compatible dishwashers, so you can easily select and adjust your dishwasher cycle settings. If this interface cover is physically broken and/or not allowing you to select and change cycles on your dishwasher, it should be replaced. Replacing it will require some disassembly of your dishwasher, so tools like a socket wrench and screwdriver will be needed. This cover panel is sold individually and does not come with the computerized control panel included.",
