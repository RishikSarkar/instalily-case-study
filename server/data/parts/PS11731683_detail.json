  "description": "Estate Dishwasher Seal ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 13 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11731683 Manufacturer Part Number W10864081 This is a seal, but you may also know it as a door gasket and it is for your dishwasher. The seal forms a watertight barrier between the door and the dishwasher tub, deterring water from escaping during a wash cycle. If your dishwasher is leaking you will need to replace the seal, as it is likely damaged. The first step should be to check the seal for buildup of food particles near the sides and the bottom of your appliance.",

    "content": "remove old seal, clean and dry the gap where the new seal will be installed. Apply adhessive, place new seal, then let dry for 24 hrs.The hardest part was getting the seal, we first ordered from a sears parts store locally. They also told me that everything was included to install it, but they did not include the adhesive, they lost the order via ups and never notified me. I finally called them and they made me go back to the parts store for a refund. I then ordered on parts select and they had it in my hands in 3 days."
