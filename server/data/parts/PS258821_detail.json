It is made of white plastic with a gray indicator line, and it is approximately 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. The timer knob turns on the shaft and allows you to choose the correct setting for your dishwasher. The main reason you would be replacing this knob, is if the old one is broken or stripped, and it will not turn the shaft. To replace this knob, carefully remove it from the shaft, and replace it with the new one. This part is sold individually and is an OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.",
