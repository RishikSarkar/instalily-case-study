  "description": "General Electric Dishwasher Gasket ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 32 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11700870 Manufacturer Part Number WD08X21894 This part is a replacement gasket for your dishwasher. The gasket creates a seal at the bottom of the dishwasher tub, so water does not leak out while the dishwasher is running. If you notice water leaking out onto the floor, you should inspect the gasket for damages and replace as necessary. The gasket is gray in color and is approximately 22 inches long. It is made of plastic and is sold individually. This is a genuine OEM part sourced directly from the manufacturer.",

    "content": "Took off the kickplate,  diconnected the wires and removed the whole door by lifting straight up, removing spring wires from hinges.  Once door is disconnected from the machine, removed one hinge by removing bolt.  Slid gasket into place, secured hinge back in place, then reconnected wires at bottom, replaced hinge spring wires and slid door back down onto hinges.  Now that we know how to do it, could do it in 15 min to half hour."
