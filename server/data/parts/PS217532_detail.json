  "description": "Hotpoint Refrigerator Light Bulb - 40W ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 8 Reviews PartSelect Number PS217532 Manufacturer Part Number 40A15 This 40-Watt light bulb is sold individually and is a genuine OEM replacement option for your home appliances. It is specially designed to withstand extreme temperatures, so this bulb is compatible with a variety of appliance types including refrigerators, ranges, microwaves, and dryers. It features a frosted glass bulb with a standard metal socket base, which allows you to easily unscrew the burnt-out light and twist the new bulb into place. Depending on your appliance, there may be a guard or cover protecting the lightbulb, in which case you may require additional tools to remove the cover. We recommend disconnecting the power supply to your appliance before changing the lightbulb.",
