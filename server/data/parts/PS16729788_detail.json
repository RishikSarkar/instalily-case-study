I called, was told I would receive a return slip,  I called again a few days later, was told I  needed to send a picture of the damage, so the agent could submit it.  First I've heard  of this.  In the meantime, I did get a replacement bin.  I did get a refund for the damaged bin, but not for shipping charges. not at all happy"
