    "content": "Had to replace the top rack in the dishwasher. Removing the top rack was a tricky.  Have to push the tab out not in on the stopper ends of the rack.  Unscrew the bolts on the water sprayer. Need to slide the sprayer instead of unclipping it. Real easy to do once it is realized.  Should have taken 30 minutes if I knew this in advance"
