  "description": "Admiral Dishwasher Heating Element ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 91 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8260087 Manufacturer Part Number W10518394 This manufacturer-certified heating element is used to create heat during the dry cycle and increase water temperature during portions of the wash cycle when certain options are selected. If your dishes are not drying or the water in the dishwasher is not getting hot you may need to replace the element. This kit includes the heater, two heater fasteners, and is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power before starting the repair. Use a multi-meter to test your heating element for continuity to determine whether this is the part that is causing your symptom. This part does not include any washers. To make your repair, disconnect the wires from the bottom of the element in the back, remove the plastic nuts holding it in place, remove the element, and repeat these steps in reverse order to install your new part. This is an easy repair that requires only a screwdriver, wrench set, and should take less than 30 minutes.",
