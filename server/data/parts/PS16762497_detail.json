    "content": "Repaired with the help of You Tube videos.  To repair: remove door (note! the door can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out, or disconnecting spring cables).  To remove the door insert allen wrench in holes under door to hold the door in the remove/ install position.  separate the inner and outer door (easily done) then remove and replace the User interface board.  The hardest part was locating the holes to insert the allen wrenches (or anything similar)  in to.  Dishwasher worked  after repair.  In my case the dishwasher would come back to life for a short period if I turned the power off, and back on.  I read somewhere that was a symptom of the bad UI board.  I was lucky because that was the problem."
