    "title": "Lower tines rusted out and would not hold dishes to clean them properly.",
    "content": "Removed two rusted tines lines, then I unclipped the stabilizers, installed four other  positioning clips, put the two adjustable tines in the two vertical plastic stabilizers at the ends of the lower baskets. Worked like a charm and all is good. May I suggest using stainless steel or more nickel in the iron used in the basket or a thicker or more durable plastic in the tines."
