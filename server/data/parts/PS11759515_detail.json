    "title": "Door gasket wasnt sealing anymore and had some minor cracks",
    "content": "First, I removed the old door gasket by pulling it out of the channel it was mounted in, noting the orientation of the gasket. Then, it was a simple matter of lining the new gasket up with the channel and pressing it into the groove. Very easy repair, and the door seals great!"
