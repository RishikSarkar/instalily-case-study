    "title": "Inlet valve leaking at water connection",
    "content": "The valve has a plastic fitting to attach the the water line with a hose fitting. Was not carful enough with the original and damaged it attaching the water line. Ordered a replacement fitting. While it is possible to replace the water inlet valve without pulling the dishwasher out from the cabinet found it was easier to get at with the machine out.  The video does and good job of showing the removal and replacing the valve. Easy job, don't be like me and be careful attaching the water line."
