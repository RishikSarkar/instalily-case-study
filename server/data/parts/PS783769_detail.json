    "content": "So there's a plastic water tank in our fridge, its purpose is to chill water so it's nice and cold when you dispense it from the freezer door tap.  Long story short, during out kitchen remodel I stored the fridge in our unheated Wisconsin garage.  The leftover water in the tank froze, expanded and ruptured it.  Got the replacement, super easy to fix.  The tubing connections are shark bite, just press them together and they're water tight.  Pretty simple plug and play operation but you do have to pull the fridge all the way from the wall and shut off the water supply.I replaced the filter too, just incase the freezing water messed with it in some undetectable way."
