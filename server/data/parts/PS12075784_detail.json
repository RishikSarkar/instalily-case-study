  "description": "LG Dishwasher Dishrack Assembly ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 3 Reviews PartSelect Number PS12075784 Manufacturer Part Number 3751DD1001J This is the lower dishrack assembly for various models of LG dishwashers. This dishrack is an OEM part that is designed to hold dishes and cutlery during the wash cycle of the dishwasher. This dishrack is made of a coated metal to prevent rusting, cracking, and peeling. However, over time and through further exposure to hot temperatures from the heating element, the coated material of the dishwasher rack can begin to peel, at which time it needs replacing. This dishrack comes as an individual part and does not come with any other parts or accessories, such as its accompanying cutlery basket.",
