  "description": "Admiral Dishwasher Mounting Bracket ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 13 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11745496 Manufacturer Part Number WP8269145 The mounting bracket is sold individually, without screws. This part secures the upper side of the dishwasher to the underside of the counter or cabinet to prevent the dishwasher from moving, shaking, or tilting forward. The bracket is made entirely of metal. It is recommended to check all brackets, if applicable, because they often wear at the same rate and both may need to be replaced. This is an OEM part that is sourced from the authentic manufacturer. Tools needed are a pair of needle nose pliers and a screwdriver.",
