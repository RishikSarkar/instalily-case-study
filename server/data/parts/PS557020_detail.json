    "title": "Water was leaking.",
    "content": "This unit was unique that whole motor assembly was held in its place by two plastic clip.  The gasket had few rings that worked as place holder, although gaskets don't go bad often this model could be if it gets pulled alot and if motor assembly get pushed it will push up the gasket and cause a leak.  Repair was simple, 1) take spray arm off from inside. 2) get under neath the dishwasher, take off wires so it would free up some room, pulled two plastic holder out, gently push the motor assembly up to the tub, 3) from inside the tub, pull up the assembly enough to get your hand under the gasket and pull them off.  4) Replace the gasket, align the assmebly and push down to snap in the gasket. 5) get under and push in two plastic clip back in, put wires back into its place.  Back in the tub to push down the assembly again to make sure there are flush with surface.  Put spray arm back on.  Finished."
