  "description": "Admiral Refrigerator Meat Drawer Shelf ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 57 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11731608 Manufacturer Part Number W10861519 This is a meat drawer shelf frame for some models of refrigerator. This white plastic frame measures approximately 12-inches wide and 16 inches long, and is used to allow the meat drawer to easily slide in and out of the fridge. If your meat drawer is currently sagging and this frame is damaged and not supporting it enough, it needs to be replaced. Replacing this frame requires you to remove the meat drawer and the glass shelf above it, so you can flip it over and slide out the old frame, and slide in the new. This frame is supplied by the original equipment manufacturer and is sold individually, so it does not include any other parts for the meat drawer or shelf above it.",
