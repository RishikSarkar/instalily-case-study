  "description": "Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit - White Wheels, Left and Right Sides ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 627 Reviews PartSelect Number PS10065979 Manufacturer Part Number W10712395 This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install. This kit comes with all the necessary parts for a dishwasher rack adjuster. It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.",

    "title": "Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)",
    "content": "Trial and error.  The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow.  The written instructions were good.  But \"a picture is worth a thousand words.\"  Eventually it worked.  The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original.  Not a good reflection on Whirlpool."
