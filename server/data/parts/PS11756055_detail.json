    "content": "Took the new kick plate out of the box. Snapped it into position. I have had a repairman for this refrigerator before. I would rather repair an appliance than buy a new one. I'm very proud that I thought to get a replacement part myself instead of calling my friendly repairman again. Saved a few dollars."
