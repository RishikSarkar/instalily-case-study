    "content": "I searched the model number for my Whirlpool refrigerator on the internet and partselect.com came up so I clicked on it.  The site asked for my model number which I typed in and there it was...a picture of my refrigerator in full detail and very well diagramed and labeled.  I found the number of the parts I needed, added them to my cart and paid.  In a few days (2 I think which is an awsome delivery time) the parts were iin my front door step, very well packaged and in imaculate condition.  I took them out of the box and installed them in less than 15 minutes.  A parts internet order and repair has NEVER gone as quick and easy as this did.  Thankyou Partselect for an awsome job and awsome website and even more awsome delivery time.  Very happy and impressed with your service.  Keep up the outstanding work!!!!!!"
