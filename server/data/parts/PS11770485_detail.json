    "title": "The spary arm and soil trap in my diswasher fell off into the heating element.  The pieces melted no longer fitting original area. Ordered the parts at PartSelect and to our amazement, the parts came the next day even though I took 3 - 5 day shipping.  We were very happy that we had a new dishwasher",
    "content": "Took no tools.  Removed the melted pieces and snapped the new ones in the machine and I was ready to start washing!!! My wife and I are very impressed with prompt and courteous professionalism of  PartSelect .  I will recommend them highly. I would rate this a 5 star rating, wasn't able to change that star from one to 5"
