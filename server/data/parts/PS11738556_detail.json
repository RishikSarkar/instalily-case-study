  "description": "International Refrigerator Crisper Frame Support ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 7 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11738556 Manufacturer Part Number WP12603701 This genuine OEM crisper frame support provides stability to the crisper drawer in your refrigerator, preventing sagging or collapse under the weight of produce. It is typically located at the bottom or near the rear wall of the fridge. If the crisper drawer feels unstable or wobbly, it may indicate a broken or damaged frame support. To replace it, remove items from the crisper shelf, then the shelf and crisper itself. Take off the glass from the top of the frame, and pull the support off the mounting stud. Note that the wall anchor for mounting this replacement part is sold separately.",
