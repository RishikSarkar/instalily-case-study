    "title": "Added parts to interior to improve capacity utilization",
    "content": "The 2 wire baskets FZ with their handles replaced one shelf in the freezer. Thus there was improved utilization of the capacity.  When we originally filled the freezer, it was obvious that about 2 cubic feet were not used.  Part numbers are WR21x10060 and WR12x10626.  A similar situation is in the refrigerator side.  We added the snack drawer and shelf pan assy. (replacing one glass shelf) and the shelf module FF to the door.  Part numbers are WR32x26244, WR71x10685 and WR71x38318.  I had to work with Parts Select Customer Service to identify the correct parts since they are not on the BOM for this model, but are on BOM's for similar capacity refrigerators.  The service representatives were very helpful."
