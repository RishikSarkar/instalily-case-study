  "description": "Dishwasher Lower Dish Rack with Wheels - Gray ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 40 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8746204 Manufacturer Part Number WD28X10384 This genuine OEM lower rack assembly is compatible with various dishwashers. It is located at the bottom of the dishwasher. Each rack has a series of tines and dividers designed to accommodate different sizes and shapes of dishes. The assembly includes 8 rollers/wheels to allow users to easily slide the rack in and out of the dishwasher cavity. The rack holds larger items such as plates and bowls and keeps them secure and stable while the dishwasher is running. If the rack or wheels are damaged, then you will need to replace the assembly to avoid damage to the interior of the dishwasher or to your dishes.",
