    "title": "Kitchenaid refrigerator shelf frames were cracking, needed replacement",
    "content": "I had to purchase two shelves and adjustable brackets - though I only needed the slidign glass shelves . Customjer service rep was helpful and pleasant, though the replacements shelves did not bear the Kitchenaid Logo or frosted scheme on glass shelves (I requested and was informed that the replacement shelves would match my Superbra) - Otherwise, parts, when available, were shipped and arrived in well packaged boxes and not damaged. Parts were cheaper than Kitchenaid, though I would call Kitchenaid first to inquire about matching parts prior to ordering from partselect, if that matters to the buyer...Matching shelves may not in fact be available from manufacturer due to age of appliance."
