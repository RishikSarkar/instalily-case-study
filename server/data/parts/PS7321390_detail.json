  "description": "Caloric Dishwasher Faucet Adapter Coupling ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 4 Reviews PartSelect Number PS7321390 Manufacturer Part Number 5304490369 A faucet adapter coupling allows the user to connect their dishwasher to their kitchen faucet, and this coupling acts as a bridge between the faucet and intake hose for its various compatible dishwashers. This coupling features a plastic end with a mainly metal construction and a threaded section near that plastic end to screw into the faucet, whereas the other end connects to an intake hose that feeds into the dishwasher. This faucet adapter coupling is sold as an individual OEM part without any other hoses or connectors but does come with smaller components inside, such as O-rings and a spout adapter. If you notice water leaking from the connector area of this adapter on your dishwasher, it is likely that the adapter has some form of O-ring deterioration, thread wear, or mineral buildup and needs to be replaced. To replace this adapter, make sure your dishwasher and sink are off, and then simply thread this adapter onto the end of your faucet and connect the non-threaded end into the hose.",

All it needed was a new caster and a faucet adapter.  After ordering the parts, they arrived in a couple days, and after less than 5 minutes of installing them I had a \"new\" dishwasher that works like a champ!  Thanks for making this so easy!"
