If your dishwasher rack is disconnected or the rack is broken, then replacing this part might be the solution. The first step in this repair is to remove the upper dishrack from the track, the next step is to remove the defective rack roller and replace it with the new one by sliding it onto the shaft and locking it in. No tools are required for this replacement and customers rate this project as easy. The roller is entirely made from plastic and is just over an inch in diameter.",
