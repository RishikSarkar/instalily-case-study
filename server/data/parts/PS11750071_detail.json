  "description": "Jenn-Air Dishwasher Rack Stop Clip ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 80 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11750071 Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195622 This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.",
