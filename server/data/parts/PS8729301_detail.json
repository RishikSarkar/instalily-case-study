  "description": "Bosch Dishwasher HANDLE-CAP SHAPED ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 4 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8729301 Manufacturer Part Number 00628998 This door handle end cap is supplied directly by the manufacturer for use with dishwashers. It is a genuine OEM part that is designed to fit just like the original piece. The end cap is made of highly durable plastic, and it is responsible for securing the end of the handle on the dishwasher door. It protects the handle from scratches, dents, and general wear and tear, which can occur over time. It also contributes to the appearance of the dishwasher by concealing any exposed screws and providing a finished look to the handles. When replacing the end caps, you will need to first remove the door panel. Each end cap is sold individually.",
