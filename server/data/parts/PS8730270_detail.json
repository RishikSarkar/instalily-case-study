  "description": "Bosch Dishwasher FILTER-MICRO ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 15 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8730270 Manufacturer Part Number 00645038 This micro filter is a genuine OEM replacement part that is compatible with dishwashers. Its primary function is to catch and trap small particles of food, debris, and other contaminants that may be present in the water circulating inside the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. This filter helps prevent these particles from clogging the pump or recirculating back onto the dishes. Signs of a faulty micro filter include poor cleaning performance, slow drainage, stagnant water at the bottom of the tub, and loud and unusual noises when the dishwasher is running. It is recommended to clean the filter once a month for optimal performance.",
