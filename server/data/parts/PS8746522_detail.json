  "description": "Caloric Refrigerator Compressor Start Device and Capacitor ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 28 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8746522 Manufacturer Part Number W10613606 This includes both the run capacitor and the start relay. The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures.",

    "title": "The compressor would not run.",
    "content": "I removed the screws in the lower back panel where the compressor is located. Then I unplugged the capacitor and plugged the new one in. I then checked to see if the compressor would start. It wouldn't so I replaced the overload relay with capacitor and that fixed the problem. The capacitor just plugs into the relay then plugs into the compressor. There are several screws but all in all it is easy."
