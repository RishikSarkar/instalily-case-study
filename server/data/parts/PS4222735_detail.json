  "description": "Dishwasher Leak Detector Sensor ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 1 Review PartSelect Number PS4222735 Manufacturer Part Number DD94-01062A This is a leak sensor designed for use with a range of Samsung dishwashers. This sensor is designed to detect if water begins leaking from the water supply. If/when it detects a leak, it stops the water being supplied to the dishwasher, preventing damage and mess to the dishwasher and home of the user. This sensor may fail when it is exposed to water, so it is important to check this sensor occasionally to ensure it still works. This is an OEM leak sensor, and attaches via its wire harness underneath the dishwasher, so tools like a screwdriver will be necessary. This sensor comes individually and does not come with any other parts or securing screws.",
