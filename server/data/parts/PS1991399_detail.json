    "title": "Gaskets magnet was tearing out. Door Handle was Broken off, Kickplate was missing.",
    "content": "The gasket came off as one piece, so all that was needed was to push the new one on. The Door Handle was broken off when we attempted to move it, the repair was removing 3 screws and replacing them with the new Handle and screws. The Kickplate just clipped into place. Everything was looking great untill 2 of the three parts went missing durning shipment. PartSelect refunded the money and sent out new parts. Chalk one up for FedEx. They said they deleiverd the packages(s) When in fact I got shipment 1 of 2. 2 Never showed up. The repair went great and if it wasnt for FedEx, the shiping went great."
