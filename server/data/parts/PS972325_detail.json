  "description": "Amana Dishwasher Door Balance Link Kit ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 203 Reviews PartSelect Number PS972325 Manufacturer Part Number 8194001 This part is a door balance link kit, also sometimes known as door cable or door spring cable kit, that helps support the door as it opens and closes by connecting to the dishwasher door hinges. The kit includes two door balance links and two door balance mounts with wheels, which will replace both the left and right sides. The only tool needed is a 5/16 nut driver. Before removing the existing kit, take note of how the door balance link kit is assembled for a smooth replacement process. It is recommended to check the door springs in case they need to be replaced as well.",

    "content": "Pulled dishwasher from under counter, attached link to spring, hooked spring back into frame/chassis, threaded link through pulleys, attached other end of link onto door, reinstalled dishwasher under counter. All's well. Note-I purchased an extra link anticipating that the other one will fail. They're cheap enough."
