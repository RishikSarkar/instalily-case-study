    "content": "Easily pulled old gasket from channel.  Soaked new gasket in warm water. Cleaned debris from channel with wire brush and CLR. Starting at top-middle, gently pressed new gasket in place. Used a gentle push-pull technique on the corners. Used fingers to smooth gasket all around. Closed door and kept latched for 2 hours. Ran dishwaher to check for leaks."
