  "description": "Dishwasher Ultra Fine Filter Kit ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 7 Reviews PartSelect Number PS12342852 Manufacturer Part Number WD49X24057 This ultra-fine filter kit is compatible with various models of dishwasher and is a genuine part straight from the manufacturer. It is responsible for catching small food particles, debris, and other items that are washed off dishes during the cleaning process. The filter stops these particles from clogging the drain hose and other internal components thereby preventing damage to the dishwasher, maintaining a clear flow of water, and reducing unpleasant odors. The filter also prevents the debris from recirculating onto the clean dishes. You can find the dishwasher filter at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is recommended to clean the filter thoroughly every 3 to 6 months.",
