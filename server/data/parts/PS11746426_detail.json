  "description": "Dishwasher Rinse-Aid Dispenser Cap ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 46 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11746426 Manufacturer Part Number WP8558307 The rinse aid cap (sometimes referred to as the dispenser cap), covers the rinse aid dispenser on the dishwasher door. If your dishwasher will not dispense detergent, or it is leaking detergent, there could be an issue with the rinse aid cap. Check the cap and its gasket for any damage or melting. If the cap has melted or it is not sealing the dispenser properly, the part should be replaced right away. This rinse aid cap comes with the gasket, so you should discard the existing gasket and rinse aid cap at the same time. The repair is relatively straightforward, and requires no tools.",
