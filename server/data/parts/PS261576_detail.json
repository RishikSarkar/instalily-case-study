    "content": "The repair was easy. A couple turns of a screwdriver was all that was necessary to remove the rollers and slide assembly. The I simple installed the new rollers. Slid the slide into place between the rollers and then added the back caps to the slide.  Replaced the rack rollers on the top basket and then slid it into position between the new slides. Once in place, I attached the end caps to the front of the slide. Simple and quick."
