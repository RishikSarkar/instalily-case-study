    "title": "Ice Dispenser not working properly",
    "content": "The ice dispenser would not dispense cubes.  It only dispensed crushed ice.  Also the plastic auger was partially broken and it took forever for ice to be dispensed.  The auger was easy to figure out that it was broken.  The dispenser issue took some time.  I removed the ice bin and removed the panel behind it.  There was a solenoid that burnt and melted and this did not allow the dispenser door to be controlled.  I ordered the parts on a Thursday and they arrived on a Friday.  Pretty simple to fix once I knew what the problem was.  I could have gotten the parts cheaper from Searsparts.com but their description of parts and their pictures did not match and I wanted to make sure I got the right parts the first time.  To be on the safe side I ordered a couple of pins and used one of them.  The pin was a little hard to remove from the existing assemble so I put it in a vice and used a small pick and hammered out the old pin."
