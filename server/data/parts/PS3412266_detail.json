  "description": "Westinghouse Refrigerator Water Filter ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 49 Reviews PartSelect Number PS3412266 Manufacturer Part Number WF3CB This NSF-Certified OEM filter is white in color with a plastic housing and extruded carbon filter media. It measures 2.3-Inches deep, 9.1-Inches high and 2.3-Inches wide. It fits certain Frigidaire side-by-side models after 2009 that use a water filter located in the back, top right. Filters all dispensed drinking water and the water used for making ice. It minimizes chlorine flavor and smell and cuts down on common contaminants by 99 percent. You will need to replace the filter every six months or when the light indicates. To install the new filter slide it into the housing and push until it locks in place. Press the indicator button for ten seconds to reset after replacing.",
