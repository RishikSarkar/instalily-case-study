    "content": "I’m a technician,I was contacted by a customer. After listening to the customers issue I determine the freezer evaporator fan was bad. Real easy job loosen  the hex head screws on top of the ice maker and pull it straight up. Disconnect ice maker wiring harness.remove the two top 1/4” screws that hold the back cover on and pull it forward. Disconnect your wiring harness and remove the whole back panel. Lay the back panel face down on the floor and remove two metal clips that are up at the top with a flat head screwdriver. Center plastic panel slides up and out maybe necessary to take a flat head screwdriver to the very top to release the plastic clip. Pull your fan blade off. On the backside of the motor just take and twist the flat plastic piece counterclockwise and remove your motor and install the new one Reassemble in the opposite order."
