    "title": "Exterior Control Panel broke next to handle",
    "content": "By way of the circuit breaker. I first turned off the electricity to the dishwasher. I removed all of the screws from the front cover, three down each side, and removed the cover exposing the front screws holding exterior control panel, I removed those screws and the screws on the back side of the panel and removed the panel. I took all of the control buttons from the broken piece and installed them and the handle strip to the new piece. I then put the new panel in place and using the original screws secured it to the machine. Also using the original screws, I secured the front cover to the machine.I turned the electricity on to the dishwasher and ran a test cycle. It worked and the handle opens the machine the way it was designed."
