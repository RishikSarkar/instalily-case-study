  "description": "General Electric Refrigerator Evaporator Fan Motor ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 137 Reviews PartSelect Number PS12741350 Manufacturer Part Number WR60X31522 This 115-volt 60Hz evaporator fan motor is located in the back of the freezer and circulates air over the refrigerator coils. These coils will convert the heat into cool air, which is then circulated. If the motor has failed, the freezer/refrigerator will become too warm because the fan motor is not circulating the cool air from the freezer into the refrigerator. This is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power to the appliance before starting your repair.",

    "content": "I removed two srews from the back panel inside fthe reezer compartment and the two that hold the air manifold/baffle? and pulled the baffle out. Then, I removed the two srews that hold the front part of the fan bracket behind the baffle and the back panel came out easily. Two more screws and one quick connect plug attached to the fan and I was done with removal. Insallation was even quicker, I slid the original fan right off the old motor and slid it on the new motor's shaft. Piece of cake! Thanks Partselect."
