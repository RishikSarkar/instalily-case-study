    "content": "There is a Philips head screw that holds the light cover on. Remove it. Pull the cover off from the back. It is rather tight so you need to pull fairly hard. Two tabs on the left side of the light hold the assembly in place. Release them and drop the module down. Unplug and do the reverse to put it back together.The manual says to unplug.the refrigerator. Power to the light can be turned off by taping the door switch down."
