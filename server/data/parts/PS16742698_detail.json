    "content": "the actual gasket tub seal was easy, 10 minutes. The trim tub gaskets were a pain because I had to uninstall the dishwasher (not plumbing or electrical) then pull it out from the cabinet, remove old trim and re-install. Re-leveled dishwasher, screwed into side of cabinets but it still leaks. Can't figure out where but after replacing all the trim and gaskets its very frustrating."
