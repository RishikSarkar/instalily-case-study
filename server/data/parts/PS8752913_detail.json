  "description": "Refrigerator Handle Screw ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 6 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8752913 Manufacturer Part Number MJB63190001 This handle screw, also known as a mounting bolt, is a mounting screw to help secure the door handle to your refrigerator door. If your handle is loose, you may just need to tighten the screw. If your screw is missing or broken, it may need to be replaced. There are multiple handle screws on your fridge, please consider ordering extra as they commonly wear at the same rate. This is about 1 inch long and metallic in color.",

    "content": "unfortunately my fridge stopped working. I purchased another but wanted to try and repair the old one. when ew one arrived, the old one was supposed to be put in garage but instead was hauled away. Had delivery return next day but they had as already removed and lost the handle screw for the bottom freezer and the screw that holds handle in place. ordered the handle screw and picked up the nut. very simple to install the screw and put handle back on."
