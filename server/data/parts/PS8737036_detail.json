  "description": "Bosch Dishwasher SPRAY ARM ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 9 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8737036 Manufacturer Part Number 00745856 This OEM upper spray arm is sourced directly from the manufacturer for use in various models of dishwasher. It is responsible for spraying water onto the dishes that are placed in the top rack. It is located beneath the top rack and consists of several small openings or nozzles through which water is propelled with high pressure. When the dishwasher is in running, water is pumped through the spray arm, and the force of the water causes it to rotate, ensuring that water is distributed evenly across the dishes for effective cleaning. If the arm become damaged or clogged with debris, you may notice difficulties cleaning your dishes properly, rattling or scraping sounds and reduced overall efficiency.",
