  "description": "Speed Queen Dishwasher Multi Rib Belt ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 105 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11742271 Manufacturer Part Number WP40111201 This dryer drum drive belt attaches to the motor pully and works the drum as the motor rotates. The belt has a length of 93- 3/6 inches, and wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pully. Replacing the rib belt could solve symptoms such as a screeching noise when the dryer tumbles, a broken belt (dryer will not tumble if its broken), no heat or not enough heat, or the dryer will not start. The tools needed for this repair are a nut driver and a putty knife. Remember to unplug the dryer before installing the part and protect your hands by wearing gloves.",
