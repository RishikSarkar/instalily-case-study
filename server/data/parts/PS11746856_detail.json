  "description": "Norge Dishwasher Door Spring ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 3 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11746856 Manufacturer Part Number WP912652 The door spring puts tension on the dishwasher door though the hinge. This keeps it from falling or dropping abruptly when opening and closing. Please note: The spring for either side of the door is sold individually. If you see that your dishwasher is leaking, the door will not close or open properly, or it gets stuck, then replacing the spring could be a solution to these symptoms. During installation, remember there is potential for the door spring to snap if it is under too much pressure. For safety precautions, make sure you unplug the dishwasher from the power source before beginning your project.",

    "content": "first i removed the 2 holding screws fron the underside of the counter then oulled the dishwasher out about a foot.  i then removed the side panel that hold the front plate in plase on the right, below this were the screws that held the door hinge assembly on the right.  i then proceeded to remove those bolts. and replaced with the new one.  replacing the spring and the linkage came next no tools required.  i have to say that the diagram when i ordered helped emensly.  i am a 45 yr old woman and fixed it by nyself thanks to your ordering diagrams.  life is good!!"
