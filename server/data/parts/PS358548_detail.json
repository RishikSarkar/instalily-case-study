    "content": "I simply had to hook up the power cord to the dishwasher so i could plug it into the outlet rather than direct wire the appliance.  Everything went very smoothly.  Everything needed for installation other than tools was provided.  Easy to follow instructions if you know a little about electrical wiring."
