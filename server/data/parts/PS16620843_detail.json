    "content": "Preface: I had to remove the dishwasher anyway since I was replacing cabinets. So sitting in the garage it took less than 10 minutes to replace both sides. If I had to do this with dishwasher installed...2 screws pull dishwasher out 6 inches, unhook the spring, unhook the cable, hook new cable, rehook spring. Dido for the other side, slide dishwasher back in place reinstall attachment screws.All that...max 30 minutes.  So easy."
