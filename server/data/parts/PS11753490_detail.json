    "title": "Compressor would not run.  My daughter was told that compressor was bad and needed to be replaced.  Cost would be $550 labor plus parts.  I could hear a clicking sound I believe was made by the starter relay.  I ordered the parts from part select and had them in three days.",
    "content": "I took the screws out of back panel and slid water line and panel off to the right side while I removed the capacitor and starter relay.   Relay was probably the only problem, but I replaced capacitor too while I was doing the repair.  Finished removal and replacement in about 20 minutes.  While I had panel off I cleaned coils that I could see from behind and then did the same on front side.   Cost was $136 for both parts.  I could have done it for $71 if I did not replace the capacitor too.   Saved my daughter from being taken advantage of."
