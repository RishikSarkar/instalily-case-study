    "content": "I diagnosed the problem via the internet.  Diagrams helped a lot.  Coils were frozen over.  Thawed them out overnight.  Manually advanced timer and the defrost heater was operable.  The defrost timer wasn't \"turning\" on it's own.  I turned the fridge back on while I awaited the part.  It worked fine for the time I had to wait.  (over two weeks since I had delayed ordering the part)  New timer arrived as promised.  Undid 4 hex head (1/4\") screws.  Unplugged 4 prong connection.  Plugged in new timer and replaced the 4 screws.  Frigde works great."
