  "description": "Crosley Dishwasher Tub Gasket - Gray ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 42 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8260227 Manufacturer Part Number 154827601 This grey OEM dishwasher tub gasket is a 73\" grey rubber part that creates a seal around the dishwasher to prevent any water leakage during a cycle. If it's damaged or broken, you'll start seeing water leaking out. If broken, it should be replaced. Refer to your model number and user manual to ensure this part is right for you. When making this repair, open the dishwasher door and take out the lower dish tray for better access. Pull out the old gasket, and clean the channel with a rag. Push the new gasket into place into the notch on the door, which you should see upon close inspection, using a flat-head screwdriver for assistance if necessary. We do not recommend cutting any additional length off on the tub gasket if any is present during your repair.",
