    "content": "Repair was fairly simple. Remove torx screws making sure that front control panel does not separate too much from door panel. Not a big deal if it does, just a little more work when putting it back together. Replacing broken part is plug and play. Reseat door panel and control panel and secure with previously removed torx screws. I’ve probably made it sound a bit more complicated than is really is."
