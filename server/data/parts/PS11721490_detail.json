    "content": "Replaced old gasket with new one.  More difficult than expected, because new gasket was much stiffer than old one.  Also, the yellow centering spot on gasket (to line up with top latch) was nearly impossible to see. Unfortunately, this did not solve the problem for me, so money was wasted. Bought new dishwasher."
