    "content": "The hardest part was disconnecting the dishwasher. the motor is located on the bottom so after pulling it out and laying it down on the front of the machine the motor unplugs and 2 screws hold it in place.The new motor comes with \"O\" rings so I applied a little grease and put it back together. 2 minutes to replace motor, 15 minutes to disconnect water and electric, 15 to reconnect."
