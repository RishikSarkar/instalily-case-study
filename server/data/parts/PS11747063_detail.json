    "title": "Water washing out under front door onto floor",
    "content": "The plastic parts on this spray arm assembly wear with time and the rotation wobble effect creates a wave action in the pool of water at the bottom of the dishwasher.  This waves the water onto the front door and forces a leak outside the unit.  Replace the lower arm assembly, washer, bearing and nut. They all wear.  Also remember to tighten the screws on top of the pump assembly.  They loosen and aid in the wobble.  Good Luck!"
