  "description": "Refrigerator TUBE-WATER ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 6 Reviews PartSelect Number PS12745424 Manufacturer Part Number W11415785 This water fill tube is a genuine OEM part that is compatible with various models of refrigerator. It is a small plastic tube that supplies water to the ice maker tray. It is typically located at the back of the refrigerator, where it runs from the water inlet valve to the ice maker assembly. When the ice maker needs to produce ice, water flows through this tube and fills the ice maker tray, where it freezes into ice cubes. The fill tube is an essential component of the ice maker system, ensuring a steady supply of water for ice production. If the fill tube becomes clogged or damaged, it can water leaks inside the refrigerator and also lead to difficulties producing ice when needed.",
