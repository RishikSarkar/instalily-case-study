  "description": "Thermador Refrigerator Seal ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 4 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11739241 Manufacturer Part Number WP2198628 This part is a replacement refrigerator drive shaft seal for your refrigerator. The drive shaft seal protects the auger motor from water and condensation that may leak down the drive shaft from the ice bucket. If the seal is broken, water and condensation can get in, causing the ice maker to fail. To replace the seal, first remove the ice bucket from your freezer. Then remove the two screws on the drive shaft holder, and use a pair of pliers to remove the drive shaft. At this point you can remove the seal from the drive shaft. Be sure to clean the area that the seal sits in before you reinstall the drive shaft. This part is white in color and is about an inch in diameter. The seal is sold individually.",

    "title": "Noisy Evaporator Motor/Fan",
    "content": "Our 48\" Built-In KitchenAid Frig (1999 model)started getting very noisy about 3 years ago.  Two different repairmen plus KitchenAid said 'that was the way it was'. I figured out the noise was coming from the evaporator motor/fan but the repairmen said it was just because moisture was freezing on it and replacing the evaporator motor/fan probably would not make a difference plus it would be very expensive. When I discovered PartSelect and that I could order the parts (about $80) myself I thought why not.  It was simple to replace.  Removed cover inside freezer compartment - detached bracket and electrical wires - replaced with new motor and fan.  Now you can hardly hear the frig running and it runs half the time - more efficient.  I can't believe we lived with that noise for so long.  Thanks to PartSelect I proved KitchenAid and the repaiirmen wrong and did it myself!  Thank you PartSelect!"
