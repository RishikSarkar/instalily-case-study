    "content": "Pulled the dishwasher out from the counter, on the lower right hand side, about mid way back there is a bundle of all yellow wires, follow that to the sensor which mounts into the bottom of the wash tub.  The sensor is easily removed by grasping it by hand and turn it about a half turn (can't remember which direction).  It then just pulls out.  Disconnect the wire bundle by pushing on the retaining clip and the install is the reverse."
