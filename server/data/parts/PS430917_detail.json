  "description": "Gibson Refrigerator Drawer Support Rail - Right Side ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 147 Reviews PartSelect Number PS430917 Manufacturer Part Number 240530701 This manufacturer-certified drawer support rail supports the right side of the sliding drawer. It is a track that helps the drawer slide open and closed with ease. If you are having trouble opening or closing your fresh food drawer, check the support rails for any blockage, or visible damage. If the rail is damaged, it should be replaced to ensure no further damage is done to the drawer itself. The repair is straightforward: unscrew and remove the existing support rail, then fasten the new rail in place. This genuine OEM replacement part is made of plastic and is white in color. NOTE: This part is sold separately from the left side drawer support rail. The part measures approximately 16 inches long by 1 inch high.",
