    "content": "It is a very difficult project due to the fact I am still waiting for the 3rd part needed to complete a 10 minute panel replacement.  If you are a contractor do NOT give your client a completion date based upon this website information.  Showing parts available, until you place your order and pay your money. You then get an email from Part Select advising you one of the parts really isn't available.  You call about a week later and are told the part will be in there warehouse by the 18.  You call the 19th and are told the part will be in by the 23rd.  God only knows if I'll ever get the part needed (a white door handle). Buyer be ware."
