    "title": "Roller wheel for crisper draw was broken.",
    "content": "The roller wheel is part of the shelf that acts as a topper to the draw and not part of the are that supports the shelf. Removing the shelf and using a Phillips screw driver, I removed the right and left arms from the shelf along with remaining wheels. Re-attaching the arms and all the wheels, I placed the shelf back on the slotted rail and inserted the crisper draw."
