    "content": "Printed door assembly parts list and photo from KitchenAid website.  (With the absence of instructions, it was a big help.)  Remove door cover.  You'll need a star driver bit.  Remove the old dispenser.  Note how the metal clamp and black cover sheet are positioned.  Install the new dispenser.  Insure the wiring harness is snapped in place.  Replace the door cover.  Not difficult; just some patience.  One more hint ... be careful when taking the door cover off and you won't have to disconnect any other wiring."
