  "description": "Refrigerator Water Dispenser Button ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 3 Reviews PartSelect Number PS8748092 Manufacturer Part Number ABH74219603 This water dispenser button is a genuine OEM part designed for LG refrigerators. When you push the button, a valve is activated inside the refrigerator, which releases water from the internal water supply. If the button is faulty, you will also likely notice that the dispenser can not release any water, or that it does so inconsistently. Over time the button may fail due to aging or due to accidental damage. You will need to replace the button if it is unresponsive when you push it, or if it seems stuck.",

    "content": "Removed the section of refrigerator that dispenses ice and water. Necessary to pry with object that does not scratch like plastic scraper. Then pull out and replace the switch Micro -- only has one Phillips screw holding switch. Replaced the dispenser and snapped on the New button assembly I broke and job was done. Works perfectly now.."
