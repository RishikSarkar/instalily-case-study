  "description": "Admiral Refrigerator Air Filter ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 43 Reviews PartSelect Number PS2580853 Manufacturer Part Number W10311524 This Refrigerator Air Filter is a white 1.8x3.2\" plastic filter which neutralizes odor and bacteria in the air. It should be replaced every six months at a minimum. Refer to your user manual and model number to see if this filter is right for your fridge. Location for storage of the air filter may vary from model to model, but generally, you will find a small cover on the back-middle-top of your fridge, which can be popped off to reveal the air filter, which can be easily changed out from there. This part does not come sold with the indicator; it is the filter only. Sold individually.",
