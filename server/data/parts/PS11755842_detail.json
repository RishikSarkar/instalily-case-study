    "content": "I'm an hvac/r technician, and regularly work on ice machines.  Begin my pulling the white over beneath the control panel.  It snaps in place so pull on the bottom then left out.  1/4 nut driver is all you need, and remove the screw holding the bin thermistor clip to the side.  Up to the right , beneath the control panel, behind the plastic panel you previously removed is the mollex connector.  Unplug the thermistor and follow instructions in reverse to reinstall."
