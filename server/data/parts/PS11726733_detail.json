  "description": "Hotpoint Dishwasher Lower Rack Wheel Kit - 8 Pack ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 157 Reviews PartSelect Number PS11726733 Manufacturer Part Number WD35X21038 This lower rack wheel kit includes 8 wheels and 8 axles that allow the lower dishwasher rack to slide in and out smoothly. If your dishwasher door will not close, is noisy when operating, or the dishes are not cleaning properly, you might need to replace one or more of the wheels. Each wheel and axle are made of plastic, and fit into one another so they can be clipped on to the lower dishwasher rack. Many of our customers found this repair to be quick and easy, and the only tool you should need to complete the repair is a pair of pliers.",

    "content": "Unsnapped clip,and moved it 90 degrees. Slip wheel and clip off. Installed clip on new wheel. replaced new wheel.  The wheel did not come with a new clip and was not suggested on the parts list. The existing clip was still OK but if it was not, I would have had to order a clip and wait. All in all, a good experience."
