    "title": "Fridgerator shorted out. Smoke coming from back.",
    "content": "There was an accidental spill which seeped through the water-hose feed hole in the bottom of the fridge. The liquid had dripped down onto the Starter and Run Capacitor and shorted them out. I called an applicance repair shop to possibly get it fixed. They estimated around $500 with the service call, parts and labor. Not a chance was they getting that from me. So I unhooked the retaining wired and removed the burnt parts. I then looked up the part numbers and ordered the 2 parts I needed from Parts Select for $50 bucks including shipping. In just two days my order arrived. I installed the 2 parts the same way and as easily as I took them out. Now my fridge is running good as new.  When my HUSBAND returned home from work he was stunned to see that I had done the repair without his help. He laughed and said, \"Yep. You da' woman!\"Mrs. S.Queens, NY"
