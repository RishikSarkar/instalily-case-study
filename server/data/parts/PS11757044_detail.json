    "title": "Ice maker's ice tray coating coming off, ice bin had foul odor.",
    "content": "I noticed the coating inside the ice maker, the lining on the surface that the water contacts when making ice, was chipping off. I replaced the ice maker with a new unit and now there's no more bits of stuff in my ice. The other problem I had was the ice bin, it had picked up a weird smell over the years and I wanted to replace it. The new bin seems flimsier, but works fine. It didn't have the top attachment hole for the ice auger mechanism drilled out for some reason, it had a little \"bump\" in the plastic where it should be, but was never drilled out. Easy enough, I drilled the hole out and attached that top screw without any issue."
