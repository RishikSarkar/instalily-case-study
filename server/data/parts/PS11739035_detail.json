    "title": "Water dispenser not working, Ice dispenser chute icing up",
    "content": "I removed the outer ice/water dispenser cover following directions I found on-line (push down and gently pry out at the bottom).  I then removed several nut-head screws which were holding a plastic plate which had the door light and electric control wiring mounted in it.  Behind that I found a broken tab on the Control Bracket which was why my water dispencer was not working and I found the chute door for the ice maker was chewed up which allowed warm air into the chute and was causing my ice build up problem.  Replacing the Control Bracket was easy.  Just note how things come apart.  Putting the chute door in was a little more complicated, but again, note how things come apart and you should not have a problem putting it back together."
