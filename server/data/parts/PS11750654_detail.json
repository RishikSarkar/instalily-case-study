    "content": "Ordered new part and installed it.  I found a repair manual online and the replacement was pretty easy.  I removed 8 screws that held the outer door and the dispenser was sitting there looking at me.  I disconnected the solenoid, pried apart two clips and the old dispenser came right out.  Reversed the process to install the new one."
