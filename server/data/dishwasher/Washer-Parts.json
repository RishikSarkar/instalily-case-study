      "description": "The drain pump and motor assembly may also be known as the washer drain pump and is a part for your washer. The drain pump helps expel water from the washing machine. The drain pump is activated after the spin cycle speed is maintained for a specific period of time. To make this installation you will need a Phillips screwdriver, a small flat-blade screwdriver, a pair of needle-nose pliers, and a pair of slip-joint pliers. Note that the pump casing is not included. This medium-difficulty repair may vary, but can generally be started by disconnecting power, then removing the top of the washer by taking out the four back screws and two small brackets. Then, remove the front panel by taking out the two screws and eight tabs that should be taken from the top. Moving down the front of the washer, remove the door, latch, tub gasket, and drain cover. Disconnect the drain hoses and clip from under the drain assembly, and install new assembly from there. Reassemble parts in direct reverse order -- taking photos during disassembly and keeping parts clearly organized can help here. Despite the number of steps, you will only need a standard Phillips screwdriver to complete this repair.",

For this repair, you will need a 1/4 nut driver, a putty knife, a flat blade screwdriver, and a pair of needle-nose pliers. Disconnect the power supply, fill hoses, and drain hose to give you safe and easy access (have a container nearby for water left in drain hose).

The agitator is subjected to a lot of force during the washer wash cycle. Constant and frequent use of the appliance can cause damage, especially during heavy loads. If youâ€™re experiencing a noisy agitator, or an agitator that spins freely in both directions, then it may be in need of repairs. If your agitator is no longer agitating properly, your clothes will not tumble, and will not be washed properly.
