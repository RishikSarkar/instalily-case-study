This manufacturer-approved part comes in gray, measures around 12 inches wide by 11 inches high, and is easy to install. It slides into the lint filter slot in your dryer. If there is visible damage to the screen then it's time to replace the part. We recommend that you thoroughly clean the lint filter before every load, but even with good maintenance, this hard-working part is often damaged or worn over time. If your dryer isn't drying quickly, the filter may be responsible. The manufacturer has made an authorized substitution to the lint filter. Special details: When replacing lint screen ADQ56656401 you may need to also replace lint screen housing MCK49049101 and lint screen guide MEA49050001 to prevent items from catching on the lint screen, depending on your model.",

      "description": "The drain pump and motor assembly may also be known as the washer drain pump and is a part for your washer. The drain pump helps expel water from the washing machine. The drain pump is activated after the spin cycle speed is maintained for a specific period of time. To make this installation you will need a Phillips screwdriver, a small flat-blade screwdriver, a pair of needle-nose pliers, and a pair of slip-joint pliers. Note that the pump casing is not included. This medium-difficulty repair may vary, but can generally be started by disconnecting power, then removing the top of the washer by taking out the four back screws and two small brackets. Then, remove the front panel by taking out the two screws and eight tabs that should be taken from the top. Moving down the front of the washer, remove the door, latch, tub gasket, and drain cover. Disconnect the drain hoses and clip from under the drain assembly, and install new assembly from there. Reassemble parts in direct reverse order -- taking photos during disassembly and keeping parts clearly organized can help here. Despite the number of steps, you will only need a standard Phillips screwdriver to complete this repair.",
