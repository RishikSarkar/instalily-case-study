      "description": "The fuel tank assembly is responsible for storing and supplying fuel to the engine in lawn and outdoor power equipment. It includes the tank, fuel cap, and fuel lines. The fuel tank assembly will fail if the tank develops cracks or leaks, or if the fuel lines can become clogged. When the fuel tank assembly fails, you will notice fuel leakage, restricted fuel supply, stalling, difficulties starting and overall lower performance. Before beginning any repairs, first drain any remaining fuel from the tank for your safety. Disconnect the fuel lines from the tank and remove the fuel tank from the equipment. Position the new tank on to the mounting holes and secure it in place. Connect the fuel lines to the engine and vent to complete your repair.",

      "description": "This hairpin clip, also known as a cotter pin, is a genuine OEM sourced part used to secure rotating components together in various outdoor power equipment. It is made of steel and is approximately 1.5 inches long. The clip acts as a fastener to prevent the moving parts from loosening and falling off during usage. The clip is vulnerable to corrosion and general wear over time. However, it can also fail prematurely due to overloading and excessive stress. A damaged hairpin clip will result in misalignment of parts, accidental disassembly, increased friction and wear, and potential harm to the user. Remove the faulty pin and align the new one with the insertion points. Ensure that the pin is securely fitted in its appropriate slot and compress the ends to prevent it from dislodging.",
